Oh yeah, forgot to put this in the weekly update:

I bought a second Lovense Diamo. Plan is to see if there's a way to cut the upper loop and use heatshrink to make the device more usable for those that find it too small, or that may want to use it with a chastity cage or something.

<!--truncate-->

The WeVibe Bond is a bluetooth cock ring that comes with a way to adjust the loop built in, but I'm still waiting for someone on the Buttplug dev team to receive one of those so I'm not sure how well it'll work with our software yet. I'm hearing that lots of people already have diamos that they can't use for one reason or another, so this'll be handy in that case.

Hoping to have that done in the next week or two, and you'll hear about it here first!
