Uh....

### Burnout
Yup, I smacked into a burnout wall a few weeks ago (mostly life/day job related) so it's been real slow going here for the past month. I should stress that this isn't necessarily a bad thing, I tend to work in cycles and this time of year (especially around the time change) usually ends up running a little slower for me. I'm slowly recovering out of it, but I expect things may stay a bit quiet for the next couple of weeks still.

### Buttplug
That said, I did manage to get some work done on Buttplug last weekend. I extended the new Pipe Manager to use Unix Domain Sockets on Mac/Linux, so now we're cross platform compatible there. That should be it for Buttplug v5.1, so I'm hoping to release that this week.

### Other Stuff

 - I finished filming the "Cut the Diamo open to see if we can make the loop bigger" video, it just needs editing then it'll be up on youtube.
 - Just because I'm moving slowly doesn't mean other developers are too! We just got a new addition to the Awesome Buttplug list, a Minecraft mod using Buttplug Java FFI! [https://github.com/Cyloci/ButtplugMc](https://github.com/Cyloci/ButtplugMc/blob/main/src/main/java/com/psiloclast/buttplugmc/commands/AddToyCommand.java)

Thanks for sticking with me through the quieter times, looking forward to my brain letting me get back to Buttplug Related Productivity. :3
