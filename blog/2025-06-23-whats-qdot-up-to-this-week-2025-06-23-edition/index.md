Updates two weeks in a row! A christmas miracle!

# Buttplug
omfg I think I'm actually on the home stretch of v4.

<!--truncate-->

The current to-do list: [https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug/issues/565](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug/issues/565)

Honestly, we're mostly to updating documentation and client libraries, and a little bit of internal cleanup. I expect documentation may take a few weeks, but I'm planning to release beta version of engine/central while that's happening.

Goal right now is to minimize any more major changes going into the library. This past weekend saw me rip out Raw messages altogether (a development feature that got used 2-3 times in the past 7 years but contributed almost 2k lines of code to the library due to all of the special casing it required) and continue trying to simplify things, but I think I'm mostly done now.

At least I hope I am.

# Intiface
Not a lot has been happening on the Intiface front as I've been so busy with the base library, but plan is still to concentrate on Central once the new spec and library versions are done. I'll probably release Intiface v3 with the same UI/features at Intiface v2.x, then start slowly upgrading UI/UX and adding features through the v3 line, with v4 being a huge UI overhaul to make things simpler up front (as I keep hearing that Central provides way too many features to people who really want to do 1-2 things).

# Everything Else
That's pretty much it for now actually. Thanks to the surprising amount of new patrons in the past week!

Until next time (maybe... next week even?!), keep buttpluggin'!
