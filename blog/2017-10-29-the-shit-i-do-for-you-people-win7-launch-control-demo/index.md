There ya go. Proof of concept demo using the Launch with Win 7 on a laptop. No VM, no tricks, this is just normal ol' Windows 7 on a normal ol' laptop.I'm using the same Plugable dongle I recommend for Win 10 users. It just requires some different drivers to be installed.

Please do not pass this video around, as I don't want a ton of people poking me about this. Getting the proof of concept going was the easy part, getting the system to the point of being usable by others and ready for release is going to require more work.

Ideally, we can just release the Buttplug Windows App Suite with this embedded alongside our Windows 10 code, so everyone can seamlessly use the same package. That's going to require some rearchitecting and orchestration in the GUIs, though.

Before that point, I may have some intermediate builds ready that people can try. I'll post here when that happens, along with instructions on which drivers you'll need.
