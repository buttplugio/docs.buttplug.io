I'm as shocked as you are. Someone just showed up to our discord server, mentioned trying to build an android app, and then all of the sudden it was ready to use and they're working on a VR movie player app too.[https://github.com/metafetish/buttplug-android/releases](https://github.com/metafetish/buttplug-android/releases)

This is an alpha release of the Buttplug Websocket Server Android App. This app works just like the windows app, in that it runs a websocket server and allows Buttplug compatible apps like ScriptPlayer, Syncydink, etc to control toys through it. I've tested it with the Launch and Lovense toys, and it worked for me.

<!--truncate-->

This means, as long as you have an android phone and it's on the same network as the computer you want to run apps on, you should be able to control toys from any OS, including Windows 7.

You'll need to download the WebsocketServer APK on your phone and install it, as the developer is still working toward getting it into a state where we can put it on the app store. Also, I personally have had problems getting SSL to work, so I haven't tried it with syncydink or playground. ScriptPlayer, which does not use SSL, did work with it for me though.

When connecting via apps on other machines, you'll need to use the IP address that shows up on the phone server UI (not the 127.0.0.1 one on there either).

Let me know if you have any questions, or feel free to hop on the discord server at [https://discord.buttplug.io,](https://discord.buttplug.io,) where both I and the developer hang out.
