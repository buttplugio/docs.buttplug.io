In terms of the first "official" release of Buttplug, we're down to days rather than weeks. The C# server/client is basically done, we're shoring up the Javascript client libraries, and making sure Syncydink is stable. The plan is to do our first release quietly, then work on growing our presence around it in a piecemeal way. Otherwise, the whole ordeal of website updates/video making/tutorials/etc would push the release out another 2-3 weeks. We'd rather have users that know what they're doing already using the software while we build these things, so we can field their questions and add those questions to the content. :)
