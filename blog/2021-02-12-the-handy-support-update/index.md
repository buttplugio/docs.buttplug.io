title: The Handy Support Update
date: 2021-02-12

Yaaay, finally get to give patrons some early news before everyone else gets it! :)

Just talked to the engineers at SweetTech (the company that makes the Handy). New firmware *should* be out today, which will support BTLE, and therefore should mean Buttplug support is possible. There's proof-of-concept code already available.

I'm going to try to work on support this weekend, and will update when that's available.
