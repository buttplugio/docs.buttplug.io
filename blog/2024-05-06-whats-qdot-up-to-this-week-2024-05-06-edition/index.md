Short weekly update 'cause I'm working on stuff, but:

DEVICE SPEED LIMITING IS A THING NOW!

<!--truncate-->

Finally got the config system into a place where device speed and movement range can be set! It works!

I'm hoping to release Intiface Central v2.7 this weekend, just got some cleanup and testing left to do. The UI is... not great and getting WAY too cluttered, but we'll live for now.
