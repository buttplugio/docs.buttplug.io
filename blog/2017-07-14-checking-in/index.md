Hey everyone! So I just learned that Patreon has exit surveys for patrons leaving your campaign. Last month, a couple of people left citing "The creator wasn't engaging like I expected.". Unfortunately there weren't any feedback comments so I'm not quite sure what it was they expected.Just wanted to let you know that if there's some sort of engagement you are expecting (like, say, the shit I put on my patron tiers :| ), do let me know. The production of the first version of the Buttplug software and Syncydink player has turned into... well, software production, thus meaning 2x-3x estimated time, and I did build the patreon on the idea of videos that are currently delayed due to that. 

Since you're giving me money, if there's something you'd like to see, poke me and tell me. :)

And speaking of things to see: SyncyDink controlled a fleshlight launch via Buttplug on windows for the first time last night! We now have a full MVP technology stack for v0.1. We'll be cleaning that up this weekend, and I'll hopefully have a post here on how to give it a shot pretty soon.
