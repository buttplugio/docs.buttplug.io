Ok, well, somehow I managed to do a livestream and forgot to notify the people paying me to let them know when I do things. Sorry about that. :(

So, yeah. I'm working on a series of livestreams to build a simple teledildonics application from scratch (think playground but with remote control). This first one covers a quick history of teledildonics, followed by a discussion of how I analyze and design teledildonics applications. There will be 4-5 parts for this first series, followed by a second series that will be kinda formless, where I just cover different topics on top of what was built in 101 (how to mod games, sync with movies, etc...).

I'll try to remember to post when I'm streaming next, should be sometime in the next few days, just gotta write up the next slide deck.
