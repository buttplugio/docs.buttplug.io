---Someone poked me on twitter about trying Buttplug using an iOS app that polyfills WebBluetooth:

This of course spun me off into actually trying to get this to work, and now it kinda does. If you have an iPhone or iPad, you'll need this app (which is annoying $1.99, mostly to help the developer pay for their $99 annual apple license):

[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/webble/id1193531073](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/webble/id1193531073)

then, in that app, check out:

I've tested it with the Fleshlight Launch and Lovense toys, they both seem to work, assuming you can ignore parts of the UI not working because in-app WebKit is horrible.

This means that Playground and Syncydink could work right now, which is nice for demos, at least. More importantly, now the new Proxy app I'm working on (that allows you to pair desktop and mobile devices so you can use your phone as a bluetooth relay) now works on both Android and iOS.
