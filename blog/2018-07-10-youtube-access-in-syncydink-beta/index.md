title: "Youtube Access In Syncydink Beta"

[https://beta.syncydink.buttplug.world/](https://beta.syncydink.buttplug.world/)Below the file entry on the syncydink side panel, there is now a place to paste in youtube urls. If you paste in a URL and hit enter (I need to fix up that UI), it'll now load a youtube video directly into syncydink. 

We don't actually check whether a URL is youtube yet, so if you try to paste another URL or something in, I can't really tell you what will happen. Feel free to test that and let me know. :)

The main idea for this feature is to make it easier to at least show demos of the player without requiring people to have videos on their drive, as well as create sync files for Buttpluggin' With qDot videos.

Also, this means that once the encoder is done, you'll be able to encode youtube videos from the syncydink interface. Fun!

I realize youtube isn't exactly as useful to most people as, say, pornhub, but I'll have to figure out if I can do direct video embeds from places like that or if they're gonna require iframe loads.

I'm sure there will be bugs with this, so please let me know what you run into, either in the comments of this post, or in the forums or discord server. Thanks!
