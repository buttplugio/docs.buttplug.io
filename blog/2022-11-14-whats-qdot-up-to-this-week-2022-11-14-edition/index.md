SO CLOSE TO DONE

### Intiface Central
Things are moving right along with Central. At this point, outside of custom devices (which is a tiny niche of our users), Central is either on par or exceeding the features of Intiface Desktop. I'll be releasing v0.0.4 after this email, which I'm probably going to call the last version before v1, unless some sort of massive bug pops up that requires me to release another intermediate version.

<!--truncate-->

Biggest new feature in v0.0.4 is the new devices panel. It's basically the same as the Desktop devices panel, except that **you can use it while clients are connected!** No more having to keep track of if the tab is connected locally and having to turn it off for clients! This may be messy, and I'll probably turn off controls while a client is connected, but I'm hoping it'll make life easier overall.

The goal for v1 is to just get SOME replacement for Desktop out that has newer features. The mobile apps are going to take a little more work, but I'd still like them out before years end, assuming the app store submission process doesn't suck.

And that is it for the moment! I'm only getting 1-2 days a week to work on things right now due to life in general being really stressful, but I'm really looking forward to getting this done and out to the world.

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
