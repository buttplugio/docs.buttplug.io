Intiface Desktop!

# Intiface Desktop
Intiface Desktop work continues apace. It's looking pretty good now!

<!--truncate-->

Which is to say, it looks pretty much exactly like it did in Electron, but now it takes up 1/80th the disk space, and 1/10th the RAM.

Not really much in the way of new features happening at the moment, as most of my time has been spent just getting us back to parity. Lots of working getting autoupdating for the device file/engine working again, rebuilding the communication between the GUI and intiface process, etc.

The goal for v41 is to just get everyone on the new platform ASAP, but I've still got some plans for it:

 - Sentry crash logging (so you aren't stuck messaging me logs on discord)
 - Errors come up as system notifications (toggleable)
 - Rolling logs (so you'll save the last 10 logs to disk, instead of just the last session)
 - Batteries Included at Install (so it'll just work out of the box!)

This are mostly nice to haves, that mostly didn't happen because the Electron/Web version of Intiface Desktop was such a godawful nightmare to work on. That said, I feel like any quality of life change here will be pretty massive for most users.

# Buttplug, Buttplug Unity, Youtube, etc...
Most of my time has been spent on Intiface, but there's been some reports of Buttplug bugs that I'm keeping an eye on. Buttplug v5.0.2 will probably be out soon, mostly with btleplug fixes for Linux.

I need to get a new Buttplug Unity build out soon too, it's been a few months and a few things have been fixed by the community, so hopefully we can get a more stable build out.

Youtube video schedule has already fallen behind because I have a really difficult time balancing working on code and videos. Still trying to figure out how to balance that out. My VR headset is now in for RMA, which is going to give me a lot more time to work on... not being in VRChat, so maybe that'll help. Or maybe I'll just completely lose my shit. We'll see!

Anyways, that's it for this week. Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
