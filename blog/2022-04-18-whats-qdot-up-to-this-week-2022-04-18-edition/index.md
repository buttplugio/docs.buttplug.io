Being very tired.

**Personal News**

<!--truncate-->

To start, news about me. Due to some family illnesses involving long hospital stays, I don't have anything close to a schedule or general understanding of time at the moment, hence not having posted updates here in the past month. I'm hoping things will return to normal soon, and with that, more update posts. That said...

**Buttplug Android**

Sitting around a hospital is pretty boring, so I decided to try a new project: Getting Buttplug up and running on Android. Most of the work here was already done, between our community contributed Java layer, as well as some work an anonymous developer did last year to hook Android into our Bluetooth library. I just needed to glue everything together and bring it up to date, which I've been working on for the past few days.

I'm happy to say that, as of writing this, I just manage to have the library find and turn on a lovense toy using my Android Pixel 3 phone.

There's still a lot of work ahead before this is distributable, but my hope is that we can have Intiface Mobile alongside Intiface Desktop, since most toys are made to talk to phones anyways. This would solve a ton of our problems with random desktop bluetooth APIs too.

**Buttplug v6**

I've also been working on Buttplug v6, but it continues to be slow going. Building the device configuration system has really proven to be difficult, but I think it's most of the way there now, and I'm down to figuring out what UI to access it will look like.

So, yeah, that's it for now, just wanted to at least post *something* since you're sending me money and all.

Thanks for your continued patronage, and until next time I have some time to post, Keep Buttpluggin'!
