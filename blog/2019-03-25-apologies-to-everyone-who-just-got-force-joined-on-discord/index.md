I was updating the tiers for this patreon campaign and didn't realize that if I change the patreon rewards, the bot will force-join everyone currently signed up that has a discord account linked. I totally didn't mean for this to happen, so apologies.

Now headed to the patreon creators forums to send a strongly worded letter about this. :|
