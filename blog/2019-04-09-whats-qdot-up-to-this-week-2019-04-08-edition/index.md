Ok, well, I'm a day late this time, but I have a good excuse because...

### Intiface
is ready to try again! At least, assuming you're on Windows 10. I'll be sending out the announcement post after this one, but I just finished Intiface v7, which basically puts Intiface at feature parity with the old Buttplug Server application. I'm still not announcing the release publicly quite yet because I've got more features and testing I'd like to have happen first, but we're creeping that direction at least!

Anyways, will leave the rest of that info for the update post after this one.

### Sticker Shipping
After some issues involving patreon payouts, I think I've gotten everything sorted, so stickers should be shipping to those of you who's address I have either via patreon entry or patreon message by the end of the week.

Anyways, since most of my work has been happening on Intiface, and I'll be sending another message about that in a sec, I don't have a lot to say in this weekly update. 

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
