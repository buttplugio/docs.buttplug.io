title: Fleshlight Launch and Vorze A10 Cyclone on the Way
date: 2017-03-14
---I now have a Kiiroo/Fleshlight Launch and a Vorze A10 Cyclone on there way to do. I have a feeling the Launch will just be the Kiiroo protocol as it is at the moment, but it'll be fun to see what the Battleship Cockrobot looks like in person (no seriously it's huge. [http://fleshlight.com/launch).](http://fleshlight.com/launch).) The Vorze ([http://vorzeinteractive.com)](http://vorzeinteractive.com)) is a Japanese toy that finally got american release. Having looked through their player software (which is literally just libvlc plus a tiny bit of glue code, and all in japanese), it seems to just be a using a USB VCP/Serial driver. Hopefully that should come apart pretty quick.

Anyways, new fun stuff to take apart, partially thanks to Patron cash! Thanks again for supporting Metafetish!
