title: "New Patreon Perk Qdot Reviews Sex Tech Porn"

Earlier this week, someone sent me some furry porn that involved the use of VR (as in the character in the picture was using VR. This is surprisingly difficult to state for some reason.).

The spirit moved me to savagely critique it from my perspective as a sex tech engineer. That review is what you see above, assuming Patreon didn't compress it to hell and back.

For reference, the picture in question is at

I ended up tweeting about it here:

Someone ([https://patreon.com/foone](https://patreon.com/foone) who does fantastic retro reverse engineering stuff so go give them your money) said that they'd sign up to the Patreon if I kept doing this for patrons.

So, here's the new tier reward (for all tiers) since that whole "Youtube Blooper Reel" one never really worked out.

Once every couple of weeks I'll go find some porn that features technology or VR in some way and will be horrible about it in text. Doesn't particularly have to be furry, though e621 is just a putrid fountain of this particular kind of filth (and I'm also furry trash) so I may lean that direction anyways.

If you have any requests, please feel free to message them to me.

I may post some of these publicly after I post them here, but they'll be Patron/Github Sponsor only for the first week if not more.

May god have mercy on us all.
