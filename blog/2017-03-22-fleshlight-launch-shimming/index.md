So, after talking to some people about the Fleshlight Launch hacking last night, I realized that the Launch really could work with almost any ona-hole style toy, all you need is a shim. Gosh. If only there was a way to get custom made, one-off plastics... :3

We're now working on some CAD models for 3D printing that should fit in the Fleshlight Launch, and allow usage of non-fleshlight toys like Tenga, Spider, etc. this would also allow for different toy offsets, as the Launch itself has a good .5-1" gap that would usually be filled by the extra length of the fleshlight insert.

Once we get models and some tests done, I'll upload the models here, as well as putting up an instructable and posting them on thingaverse.
