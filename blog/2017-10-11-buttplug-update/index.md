Ok, time to make an "I'm not dead" update.I'm not dead.

There's lots of work happening on Buttplug right now, but most of it is fairly invisible. I've been spending lots of time learning about how to properly build web app dependencies so developers can start using the same components I used to make Syncydink and Playground. This has taken more time than planned (was a rather complex learning process to get typescript/vue.js/webpack to all play together nicely), but is finally done. The hope here is that people that want to write new webapps for buttplug can do so quickly and easily with these components.

BTW, if anyone is experienced with React/Angular/other frontend frameworks and is interested in helping build a similar component set for those, please let me know.

Playground is now complete as a minimum viable product. It allows users to test vibrating toys, the Fleshlight Launch, and the Vorze A10 Cyclone. This means I can now start making user documentation built around it, to introduce people to the current Buttplug workflow. Really hoping this relieves some of our support load once finished.

On the protocol side of things, we're starting work on handling getting input from devices (accelerometers/buttons/sensors/etc), as well as the inevitable "downgrading" situation, which refers to using new clients with old servers and vice versa. Getting all of this done soon should hopefully future-proof us for a while to come, at which point we can get back to doing fun stuff like movie player integration and game engine plugins.

I'll be spending the rest of this week preparing and filming new tutorials, as well as playing with some interactive documentation/tutorial systems to see if those work better that videos. I may also try to slide a haptics-file-only player into Syncydink, as we're getting requests for that now and I'd rather not block it on the whole haptics editor system getting done.

As always, if you have any questions/requests/etc, feel free to messages me here or ask in the comments. Thanks for your continued patronage, and I look forward to making slightly more exciting updates soon.
