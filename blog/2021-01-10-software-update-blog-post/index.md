Now that Buttplug is post v1, I'm trying to be a little more public in the "what I did" stuff, so the Monday newsletter here can hopefully focus more on "here's what I plan to do" with the ability for you to give me feedback. This is the first blog post I've made with updates from the past 2 weeks, including a lots of library updates and a new GHR version.
