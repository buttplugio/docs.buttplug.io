Rewrites!

### Intiface Desktop
After a couple of weeks of having problems with coding blocks (writers block except for programming), I seem to be back to vague levels of productivity. This mostly means re-implementing Intiface Desktop in Rust and egui.

<!--truncate-->

So far, everything is going quite well. The resulting binary will be < 10MB (instead of 190),  and it should take < 20MB of RAM while running. It's *really* streamlined, and much easier to work with. I have config file saving/loading, as well as most of the UI outside of the devices tab done (there's really not much to Desktop at the moment). The next major portion will be tying the engine and GUI together so it shows the client name/device connected updates again, then I'll probably call it good enough for alpha while I work on adding back the devices tab.

Once things are to that point, I'll be posting installers here for everyone to check out.

### Youtube
Took a bit of a break from trying to do weekly Youtube this week since I've been busy on code, but expect more videos soon.

That's it for now. Pretty singularly focused on making Desktop something I don't hate working on, so not much otherwise to talk about. My Valve Index is going in for RMA this week, which will probably multiply my productivity since I won't be able to get in VRChat. :)

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
