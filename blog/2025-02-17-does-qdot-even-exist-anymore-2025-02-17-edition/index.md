Sorta.

# Life
For those not aware, I unexpectedly lost my last job in October 2024. Ok, it was actually kind of expected, we were a startup with iffy funding prospects. I just didn't expect it to collapse as fast as it did. Last time I wrote one of these updates was about 2 weeks after that happened.

<!--truncate-->

I was luckily able to move into a new position at an even smaller startup in December. That's been going well, but due to the hectic nature of being at a tiny, under-resourced company, I haven't had time for... much of anything other than work, really. Hence the lack of updates outside of random twitch streams and media appearances. There's not been much of anything to say on the code front.

Things haven't really calmed down, but I'm now trying to regain at least some hobby time to make sure I don't burn out completely. 

# Patron Benefits
Many of you have signed up since last time I did a patron survey, so I'll be sweeping through again to get an idea of who wants their name included in Intiface Central builds.

If anyone else has extra benefits they'd like to see on this Patreon, please let me know. I'm 8 years into having this and still trying to figure out how to grow it.

# Buttplug
Buttplug did get a good bit of work done on it in the time between jobs. Version 4 of the spec and library continued to roll along, though it came to a screeching halt once the new job started. I've now gotta go back and figure out what was left to do, which is going to be difficult because it was mostly esoteric/challenging bugs and features.

One of the things I may prioritize is getting a new website up. While the current site has... well I hate to say it's served us well, 'cause honestly it's mostly years out of date at this point. The plan now is to just have a simple front page to our docs site ([https://docs.buttplug.io](https://docs.buttplug.io)) that outlines the library, and possibly a better formatted version of our awesome list ([https://awesome.buttplug.io](https://awesome.buttplug.io)). May also add a blog. Dunno.

# Intiface Central
Intiface Central is basically stagnant right now. Any updates are mostly around device additions or bug fixes, but it's hard to tell when I'm going to get time to do UX work or add more features. Luckily no one is really asking for that.

At some point, I'm really hoping to add some small utilities to Central, like a REST API for device control, desktop audio reactivity, maybe a very simple funscript playback system, etc. Nothing fancy, just simple utilities people keep asking for, that can be used on both desktop and mobile. These are all things that have been implemented in one way or another outside Intiface, and I really don't want to step on the community's feet, but for both the REST API and audio following, none of the utilities stay maintained for long and there's confusion about what to use. We'll see if implementing that in a central place fixes it or just makes things worse.

# Everything Else
Despite my lack of activity, people are still writing Buttplug mods and apps, which is great. The BalatroBuzz plugin got a decent amount of attention, and we've had other announcements happening in the discord and on social media lately.

Wish I had more concrete things to announce, but right now it's pretty much returning from basic survival mode. 

That's it for now. Until next time, keep buttpluggin'!
