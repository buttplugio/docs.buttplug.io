Episode 1 production time: 3 weeksEpisode 2 production time: 2 hours

After getting support for translating Kiiroo commands to Gamepads, figured I'd finally post a demo of what the current state of Buttplug looks like. The good news is, I've also had a couple of outside testers who've managed to get it working with both gamepads and the Fleshlight Launch! This is starting to look like it may be releasable. :D

I need to nail down a few more things on the programming side, then there's a TON of documentation to write. In the video I say release in the next couple of weeks to keep things conservative, but as you know from being patrons, artifacts builds are available on appveyor, and they tend to stay fairly stable now (though my test coverage is plummeting at the moment :( ).

Thanks for supporting the project!
