So much for that Quiet End Of The Year wish.

### Life
A couple of weeks ago, my workspace in my house flooded due to some broken plumbing. The good news is, no hardware was damaged. Almost no material losses really. The bad news is that we're still dealing with insurance and water remediation, and that's gonna take a while, so I'm having to work from another space, and all my hardware and stuff is packed up for the moment. This has caused what few schedules I did have to no longer really exist.

### Patreon Rewards
Due to the aforementioned events, making videos isn't really happening like I thought it was going to, which means my addition of video credits to rewards isn't really working out. I'm going to add Patreon Rewards for $5/month and up that include getting credits in Intiface Central (with people in higher tiers getting... a bigger font or something). This is OPT-IN, so you'll need to let me know you want in and what you want your name to be there. I'll be messaging everyone at or above this level soon to confirm.

### Intiface Central and Buttplug
Despite having to move my workspace and all, I'm still getting releases of Intiface Central done. I released 2.5.1/2 this past weekend, which should fix some small bugs. I'm now starting on some slightly larger feature work to get features like desktop/mobile repeaters, better error communication, and more extensibility in on the UI side, while continuing to refine the requirements for the next protocol version of Buttplug on the internals side.

### Everything Else

 - We now have not 1 but 2 options for Unreal Engine support! [https://github.com/DeviantdVeloper/ButtplugUE](https://github.com/DeviantdVeloper/ButtplugUE) and [https://github.com/epsypolym/Buttplugin](https://github.com/epsypolym/Buttplugin)
 - There's work happening on a Slay The Spire buttplug mod! Realizing I don't have the github for that yet but hopefully it'll be up soon

That's it for now. Until next time, Keep Buttpluggin'!
