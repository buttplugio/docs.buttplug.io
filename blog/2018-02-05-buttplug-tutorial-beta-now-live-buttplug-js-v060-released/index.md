[https://metafetish.github.io/buttplug-tutorial](https://metafetish.github.io/buttplug-tutorial)Been spending the last few weeks putting this together. It's a Twine (interactive fiction engine) based tutorial for getting people up and running with the basics of the Buttplug App Suite. Probably not going to be much new for patrons here, but if you have feedback, do let me know. I'm hoping to use it as our main guide for both the Buttplug App Suite (which will be changing names at some point in the nearish future I hope) as well as things like Syncydink, and maybe even outside apps like ScriptPlayer if the authors are interested.

The tutorial has been a pretty heavy test of the buttplug-js library, and I've just pushed v0.6.0 which has most of the features and bugfixes required. Hoping to get playground and syncydink on this soon too, should fix a few bugs there.

Also, we've just added support in buttplug-js for a $10 bluetooth vibrator you can get off Amazon US: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017N016S4](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017N016S4)

Hopefully going to have C# support soon too. If you want a cheap toy to test with, this is definitely the way to go, though we're still working on reversing the complete protocol. Right now all we can do is control vibration speed (but we can't actually turn off vibration, just turn it down to the lowest level. Kinda weird.), or power off the vibrator completely. :)

That's it for now.
