Wow. Completely flaked on an update last week. I blame Yakuza 0.The good news is, I have finished Yakuza 0 and resumed doing other things with my life. Buttplug related things even!

I just merged the new client examples into Buttplug C#'s mainline:

<!--truncate-->

[https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-csharp](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-csharp)

The hope is that these examples will help developers learn how to use Buttplug, 'cause otherwise it's been fairly opaque so far.

Writing these took quite a while because it was also the first major usage test of the new Client API I've been working on over the past couple of months. I found some problems with this code while I was building the examples, so this became half documentation half bug fixing.

I'll be working with some other developers to refine these tutorials, as well as continuing to clean up the Client API and prepare for the C# 0.3.0 release.

Exciting times ahead! I hope! 'cause damn if this work ain't needed but kinda boring, heh.

In other news:

- I just finished giving a remote talk at Teasecraft Boston! This is the first presentation on Buttplug I've ever done, went really well!

- I'll be in Toronto in November, speaking at SLSA 2018 ([https://litsciarts.org/slsa18/](https://litsciarts.org/slsa18/) )! My presentation is entitled "Caressing the Tower of Babel: Communicating and Translating Intimate Touch in the Digital Realm", which will be part of the "Quantifying the Body and Its Extensions" panel (this is a media/literary theory/critique conference, hence the titles like this). I have less than 2 months to make something worthy of that title, so I should probably get on that.

- Things are pretty quiet otherwise. Got a new piece of hardware in (SenseMax Sense Band) that I'll be checking out at some point.

As always, thanks for your on-going support!
