title: "Translating Buttplug"

Now that the Buttplug website is in order and I have some vague ideas about software direction, I'm looking at getting translation work done. I *think* this is i18n work, but I'm not sure and don't want to confuse anyone that actually knows what they're talking about, so I'm just saying translation. I posted about this on twitter and already have interest for German, French, Spanish, and Ukrainian. Japanese is a major goal that's currently not covered right now, so definitely looking for that. The first translation priority will be the Buttplug website at [https://buttplug.io,](https://buttplug.io,) which doesn't have a ton of text on it but is key for bringing in new community and contributors. Hoping this will be a good way to iron out the process, as this is also gonna be the first time I've ever done this on one of my projects. After that, we'll look at documentation, libraries, and applications, figuring out which translations would best serve the community. 

Right now I'm figuring out which translation service I want to use. I'm pretty sure I'm going with [http://crowdin.com](http://crowdin.com) . If anyone has worked with that or any other services like [http://transifex.com](http://transifex.com) , [http://phraseapp.com,](http://phraseapp.com,) or others and have opinions, please do let me know, 'cause I'm starting from basically zero knowledge here.

If you've done this kind of work before and have advice, or are interested in helping expand the Buttplug community by translating some of our work into new languages (or can help cover the languages already listed), please feel free to message me on here.
