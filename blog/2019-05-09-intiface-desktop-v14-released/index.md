Managed to break through my coding block a bit to get the new version of Intiface Desktop out.

<!--truncate-->

Nothing real groundbreaking in this release, mostly just some insignificant UI updates and fixes. Mostly wanted to get the Home panel in, and the About panel populated a bit.

Hoping that we're near the end of private alpha and can start looking at a public alpha soon. Mostly I just need to update the tutorial, and possibly add some documentation/tutorials to the program itself.

Been working on the features for Proxy alongside this, so I'd like to get that integrated soon too, so we can start supporting things like standalone VR headsets via having them connect to laptops/desktops (and later, phones) for bluetooth access.
