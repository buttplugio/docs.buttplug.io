date: 2021-03-08
---VRChat, mostly. I wasn't kidding about the virtual world obsession thing.

### Buttplug
But I also fixed some Buttplug stuff! v2.1.7 just went out the door before I wrote this, fixing some issues with Vorze devices and the Handy for software using older buttplug versions like ScriptPlayer and Syncydink. Also fixed some issues with Kiiroo vibrators. Intiface CLI (aka Intiface Engine) v33 is in CLI now, should release in the next 10 minutes or so.

And... that's kinda it for this week, really. I'm still dealing with a pretty massive amount of burnout so getting code work in has been *extremely* difficult. Fucking around in VRChat has been great though, doing a lot of thinking about future projects, interactive systems, etc. I'll hopefully have more to post on this soon.

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
