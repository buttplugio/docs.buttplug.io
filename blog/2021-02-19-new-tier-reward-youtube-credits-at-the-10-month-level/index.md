title: New Tier Reward Youtube Credits At The 10 Month Level
date: 2021-02-19

Interested in having your name posted in my youtube videos?

Then sign up or bump up to the $10/month or higher level!

<!--truncate-->

For anyone at that level or higher, I'll be offering **OPT-IN **credits on my patreon video! There will be credits screens at the end of videos I make (which there will hopefully be more of soon), and you can have your name (either patreon name or other name that you specify) there for as long as the video is on youtube!

This is opt-in because I realize the nature of my videos may not be something that everyone wants to attach their names to in public, so it's something that I want to make sure people consent to before I throw their name on there. :)

Also note, changing tiers in Patreon is... weird, so if you're already subscribed at a lower level and want to bump up, please poke me when you do as I'm not sure exactly how Patreon handles that in terms of notifying me.
