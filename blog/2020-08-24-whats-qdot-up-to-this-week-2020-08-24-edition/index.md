Missing a week of updates, but for good reason I guess?

### Intiface Desktop
INTIFACE DESKTOP IS BACK BABY. It's good again. Awoouu (wolf Howl)

<!--truncate-->

Ok well dril quote shitposting out of the way: Intiface Desktop is finally getting an upgrade after 15 months. 

It took me most of the past 1.5 weeks, but I've updated Electron (from v4 to v9 >.> ), as well as the vue packages it runs on. Other than that, it's pretty much the same thing...

Except now it'll download the Rust engine! :D

The plan now is to get a few UI fixes in, make the Rust Engine a beta choice on windows (it'll ship default on Mac/Linux, because I'm sick of node), and ship v17, possibly sometime this week.

### Buttplug
With Buttplug-rs being a usable engine, protocol implementations now become extremely important, because things like the Fleshlight Launch still aren't implemented there yet. On top of that, I expect buttplug-rs being available in Intiface Desktop will dredge up all sorts of bugs, so there's going to be a development loop between Desktop and the core library again that I expect to cause lots of minor version upgrade churn. This happened with C# also.

### Lovense Protocol/Firmware Updates
I'm getting more and more requests to fix Lovense firmware update issues that caused their toys to stop working with Buttplug. I need to get around to this soon, hopefully happening this week. This will necessitate a release of C#, JS, and Rust. :(

### Stickers
Stickers continue to ship! I've got all of the US domestic stickers mailed, working my way through international now, but should be completely caught up this week.

The goal now is to keep up per-month with shipments. I hope.

That's it for now. Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
