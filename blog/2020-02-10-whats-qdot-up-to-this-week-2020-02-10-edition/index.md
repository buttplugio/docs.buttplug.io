AND WE'RE BACK

### Buttplug
Finally hit the end of my respiratory infection, so to celebrate I sat in front of the computer all weekend and worked on buttplug-rs. Do I know how to party or what?

The good news is, we're down to the boring parts! Which means things like writing tests to make sure the system as a whole basically works before shipping the next version of the library. It's nice to be at this point, as it means the system is vaguely usable and now just needs to be verified.

### Upcoming Events
The next month is pretty packed with speaking gigs.

 - Feb 12: Out in Tech panel on Sex Tech in San Francisco - [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/out-in-tech-sf-lets-talk-about-sex-baby-tickets-88574531809](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/out-in-tech-sf-lets-talk-about-sex-baby-tickets-88574531809)

 - Mar 18-20: Game Developers Conference in San Francisco - [https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/sexy-microtalks-designing-sex-and-emotions/868910](https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/sexy-microtalks-designing-sex-and-emotions/868910)

### After that, I have absolutely nothing. I've been trying to keep the back 3/4ths of the year clear to work on project development.

### Upcoming Youtube Videos
I'll have some new Youtube Videos coming up in the next couple of months! There's been quite a few DIY projects that've been taking off, and I've also got some new hardware incoming that I'll be showing off.

That's it for now! Thanks again for your support, and until next week, keep Buttpluggin'!
