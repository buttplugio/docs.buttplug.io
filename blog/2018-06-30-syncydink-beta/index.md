[https://beta.syncydink.buttplug.world](https://beta.syncydink.buttplug.world)Here's the URL for the beta of the upgraded Syncydink. Outside of the widget set changes, the biggest change right now is to Video Modes. 

Mostly, that there aren't Video Modes anymore. :)

<!--truncate-->

My assumption right now is that less people are using Syncydink for VR than for regular old 2D movies, so having the modes front and center was a little silly when not that many people needed them, and maintaining the split mode was a god damn nightmare.

This doesn't mean VR is completely gone though, there's just some new steps to get to it.

When you open the side panel, there is now an "Enable VR" checkbox. You'll need to check that, then when you load movies, there will be a "VR" button on the movie control bar. 

Note that if you're on a slow connection the "VR" button popping up on the control bar may take a few seconds. Syncydink downloads the code for the VR player whenever you enable VR, which saves around 40% of our initial load amount (Syncydink is around 400kb base gzipped and minified, and the VR is another 300kb on top of that).

Anyways, clicking that button will send you into fullscreen VR mode, which should display in a helmet/phone/etc if you have one hooked up.

There's really not any new features here to speak of yet, so don't get too excited. The work so far has mostly been cleanup to make sure changes I want to make in the future will be easier to do, so new features are coming, they're just still a bit in the future. :)
