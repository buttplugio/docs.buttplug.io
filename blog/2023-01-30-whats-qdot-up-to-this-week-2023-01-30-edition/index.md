### Buttplug
Having released v7 of Buttplug over the holidays, I've now shifted over to documenting things as best as possible. At the moment, this is a combination of updating the [Buttplug Developer Guide](https://docs.buttplug.io/docs/dev-guide), and trying to get our API docs for Rust/C#/Typescript etc in some sort of working order.

This work is going well, if slowly. There's just a lot of information to fill in since the library is rolling up on 6 years of existing, and it turns out that writing understandable words about technology is hard, exhausting work.

I also finally overhauled the Unity plugin to basically be a repackage of the C# Client DLLs. This is sitting in a branch in the Unity repo currently, but will become the main distribution of Buttplug Unity very soon. I'm hoping this, alongside better documentation, will make life easier on game devs.

### Intiface Central
Most of my concentration in Central right now is Mobile App Foregrounding. This is the fancy way of saying "toys will stay connected and you can still control them when the app is in the background or the phone is off". I have this working pretty well in Android as of this past weekend. iOS works-ish, but is going to take some extra considerations due to Apple's strict rules on foregrounded services. It *is* possible to support this (Lovense Connect/Remote work fine on iOS devices when backgrounded/off, for instance), it's just not something I'd originally planned for in Buttplug, so changes need to be made.

### Everything Else

 - Been getting some new additions to the [Buttplug Awesome List](https://awesome.buttplug.io) 
 - I'm apparently a big enough deal to get my own Lovense Sale now, so if you want like 10% off on a toy thru this upcoming Friday: https://[lovense.com/p/buttplugio](https://www.lovense.com/p/buttplugio)

That's it for now. Until next time I remember to actually send one of these things to the people who pay me to send them these things, Keep Buttpluggin'!
