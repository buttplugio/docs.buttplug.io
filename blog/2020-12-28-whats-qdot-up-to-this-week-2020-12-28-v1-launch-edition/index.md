---LAUNCHING V1. WOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

### Buttplug
I LAUNCHED V1.

<!--truncate-->

WOOOOOOOOOOO.

Yeah that's pretty much it. Rust/C#/JS V1 are out, announced on the Nonpolynomial blog here:

Made reddit and HN (Ok I posted both of these but they trended well enough!):

It's been a good day! Mostly been fielding questions and replying to comments, but as usual, everything was pretty positive.

The rest of the week is going to be continued cleanup, as well as starting work on updating:

 - Intiface Desktop: yanking out the C# stuff, adding in downloading of the new device config file.
 - Intiface Game Haptics Router: Updating to use C# v1, connect to Intiface Desktop, maybe finally fix process detaching.
 - VAMLaunch: Updating to use C# v1, connect to Intiface Desktop
 - Playground: Updating to v1
 - Buttplug Unity: Possibly updating to v1 but may run into architecture issues here.
 - Buttplug Twine: Updating to v1
 - Buttplug.io website: Finally update front page, move apps/dev links to pointing at awesome-buttplug repo
 - awesome-buttplug repo: Actually fill this in with projects. Was gonna do this before v1 but just wanted to get v1 done.
 - Documentation: Continue filling out the Developer Guide, tighten up language API docs

Ideally I could finish all of this (minus documentation) in the next couple of days, but that's a pretty long list now that I've typed it out, so, uh, we'll see.

### What's Next That's Not Maintenance
Here's some possible upcoming projects:

 - OSR2 Support, finally.
 - Handy Support, once FW3 drops.
 - Python Language support
 - C/C++ Language support (god I hope I'm not the one that has to write this :c )
 - Poking at that whole teledildonics/device forwarder idea in Rust

And who knows, maybe something actually fun, too. :|

But, for now, I'm just relieved I got v1 out.

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
