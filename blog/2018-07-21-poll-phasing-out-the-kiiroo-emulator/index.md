title: Poll Phasing Out The Kiiroo Emulator

Most of the crash reports we get from Buttplug C# these days have to do with the Kiiroo Emulator. For those not aware, this application simulates the old Kiiroo server that was used with the Onyx 1 and Pearl 1 before FeelConnect was a thing. The movies at [http://flicker.tv,](http://flicker.tv,) which is where we usually directed people for easy to get free films, expect the server, but we've built readers for their file format into Syncydink and ScriptPlayer, so that's not as much of an issue. Kiiroo took the actual server out of production around the time Buttplug started development, but I used the simulator as a test for early builds and it's just kinda stuck around since.We'd like to remove the Simulator completely, as it'll be one less application to take care of for us, but I want to make sure no one has any dependencies on it before we do that. I've got a twitter poll up at [https://twitter.com/buttplugio/status/1020800900829286400,](https://twitter.com/buttplugio/status/1020800900829286400,) but I'm posting a poll here 'cause you're all paying me so I listen to you more. :)
