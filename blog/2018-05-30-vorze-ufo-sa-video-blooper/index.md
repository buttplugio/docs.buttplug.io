I'm currently filming the Buttpluggin' with qDot UFO SA overview video. I was trying to record some of the movies that came on the demo disc, but I forgot to turn my voice over mic off while recording. It ended up picking up the sound of the UFO SA being controlled by the video, which, without visual context, ends up... yeah.Please enjoy the sounds of robot nipples being tweaked.
