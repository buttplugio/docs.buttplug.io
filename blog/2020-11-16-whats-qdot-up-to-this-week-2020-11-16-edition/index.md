Preparing for a whole week off! And otherwise doing some out of the ordinary stuff.

### Youtube
Finished up the OSR 2 overview last week, which currently is pulling somewhat disappointing numbers on youtube but it's been hard to drum up interest in it.

I've got a Kiiroo Keon unboxing video that needs editing, hoping to have that up this week.

After that, I've got a ton of new hardware in within the past few weeks, so probably filming lots more unboxings soon. I'm not sure how popular these are, but they're easy content.

Also hoping to startup the "Ask A Buttplugger" series ASAP, so get your questions in if you've got them!

### Buttplug Developer Guide
Yes, I'm actually working on documentation again! I really don't want to release v1.0 without also letting people know how to use it, so I'm writing the dev guide as part of API polishing. Adding new examples and cleaning up old ones gives me a way to figure out what parts of the API need refinement. You can read the current version at

[https://dev.buttplug-developer.guide.docs.buttplug.io](https://dev.buttplug-developer.guide.docs.buttplug.io)

This is updated as I push to the repo, so there should be new stuff to read every day or two. Right now the Foreword and Intro are done, and I'm working on the Architecture section. Things will slow considerably after that, as most of the code examples are in the Writing Applications section that comes next, so getting all of those right will take a bit.

### Syncydink
Thanks to the release of the Kiiroo Keon, I'm finding out how many people use Syncydink on mobile. Mainly because they're all messaging me going "WHEN WILL SYNCYDINK WORK ON MOBILE"

So, the answer is "Soon, hopefully?". I'm really hoping I can port syncydink to buttplug-wasm soon. Even if it's the same old crappy UI on top, it'll support new toys.

Funny enough, I got my first contribution request for Syncydink on Github tonight too! Poor developer has no clue what they're getting into.

### Buttplug
As I mentioned, Buttplug is mostly down to polishing now. There are definitely still bugs, and the bluetooth core is still an absolute mess, but I'm more worried about getting to v1 then fixing things with an actually released library than I am trying to refine forever.

I'm off work from my dayjob all of US Thanksgiving week, so I'm hoping to spend quite a bit of time working on code, docs, and videos!

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
