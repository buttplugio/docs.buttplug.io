title: Buttplug C 010 Released

Finally gave up polishing. Ship it.[https://github.com/metafetish/buttplug-csharp/releases/tag/0.1.0](https://github.com/metafetish/buttplug-csharp/releases/tag/0.1.0)

This will most likely be the only place I announce this release, as I'm now going to be spending the next while building documentation and tutorials around it. Otherwise no one will have a clue how this is supposed to work.

Most of my testing with Buttplug has been on syncydink, which is now in rolling release at

[http://buttplug.world/syncydink](http://buttplug.world/syncydink)

As of tonight, syncydink can play either 2d or 180SBS VR movies. 

- For 2D, pretty much anything works. Even phones.

- For VR, you'll need Firefox 55 or higher. Chromium VR won't work yet as it doesn't have a mp4 decoder in it. This MAY work on mobile chrome but I haven't tried it (don't have hardware to do so).

In terms of file formats, we now support:

- Funscript

- VirtualRealPlayer

- Kiiroo (flicker.tv)

- Feelme

These movie files will turn into either Fleshlight Launch or SingleMotorVibrate (Gamepad, Lovense) commands. I may add support for Vorze movie files and hardware pretty soon too.

I realize there's not a lot of information around on how to get all of this working together, and that's what I'm planning on spending the rest of the week working on. I just figured I'd let everyone here know first since you're, you know, paying me.

Thanks for supporting me through this first development push. I'm hoping things from here on out will happen in more of a rolling manner, so it's not just 3 months of "one more week".
