Oh my fucking god, I thought I was never going to get this finished. 43 minutes of hardcore buttplug engineering analysis about the Fleshlight Launch.I realize this is a REALLY long episode to start on, but I think I subconsciously decided to just throw all of my ideas at this and will now see what sticks. Upcoming videos will hopefully be closer to the 10-20 minute range, and divided into multiple videos if they're gonna break that limit.

If you've got comments or suggestions, please let me know! This is my first foray into youtube video making, so I'm sure I've got a ton more to learn. Note that you'll probably get another post notification about this video too, as I'll be making a public patreon post once I get all of the cards/annotations/transcriptions done. But I figured I'd like patrons in on it now. :)
