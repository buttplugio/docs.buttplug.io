Life can really just stop it at any point now.

# Intiface Central
But the good news is, at least progress is happening sometimes! I've managed to get Intiface Central v2.4.3 out to all platforms, which has a lot of quality of life work, as well as some pretty important bugfixes (especially for Android Bluetooth).

<!--truncate-->

Also, I'm now working on Intiface Central and GHR Documentation! It's available at

[https://docs.intiface.com](https://docs.intiface.com)

Right now, I'm mostly porting over the Buttplug FAQ, but at some point there will also be actual documentation on how to use Intiface

# Buttplug
Every time I try to work on Buttplug at the moment, I keep running into issues with the current message spec, so I've given up trying to work around those spec problems and am just working on fixing the spec itself now (which means we're on to Buttplug v4, a year after v3 landed). This gets back into boring, in-the-weeds developer stuff, but as always, in the end hopefully it'll be easier for everyone.

# Everything Else

 - As mentioned at the start, due to family medical events, day job events, etc I have had pretty much no time or energy to do much of anything since May, so things are going *very* slowly right now. Thanks to everyone who's still signed up here, I'm not dead, it's just... not been a great year so far.
 - I'm hoping to maybe start getting to either more writing or videos here soon, as code has been a bit difficult to get around to lately. We'll see how that pans out, will post updates here if/when that happens.
 - For those looking for me on social media, I'm mostly over on bluesky at this point, at [https://bsky.app/profile/buttplug.engineer](https://bsky.app/profile/buttplug.engineer) or [https://bsky.app/profile/buttplug.io.](https://bsky.app/profile/buttplug.io.) If you're looking for an invite, let me know.

Until next time, Keep Buttpluggin'!

- qDot
