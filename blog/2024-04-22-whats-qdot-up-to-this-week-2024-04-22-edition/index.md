Starting to think I've built a complicated platform...

### Buttplug
Over the past 6 weeks I've been reworking the system we use to store device information in Buttplug. The first major phase of that project is mostly done in Buttplug itself. We have a new format for our base device configurations, and the way we load/store specific user device information has been overhauled.

All of this work will make things like "setting speed/movement limits on devices" and "adding DIY devices" and "adding simulated devices" far easier that it would've been with the old system. In fact, config was most of what was blocking all of these from happening, because the original system was designed just to bring in base device info, not actually be customized.

Anyways, I'm now getting all of this wired up through Engine and Central, which I suspect will still take a while longer. I may also start releasing beta versions for people to test, which I'll post about here if/when they happen.

### Intiface Central
New version of Intiface Central is out! This should fix the issues that've plagued the Lovense Solace since January, as well as adds support for a ton of JoyHub devices (as well as Kiiroo and Lioness). 

That's about it for the IC update, really. I've been so busy on the lower levels that I didn't have much time to change anything in the UI.

### Everything Else

- I'm currently working on updates to our Apps/Games list, worth checking it out if you haven't in a while! [https://awesome.buttplug.io](https://awesome.buttplug.io)

That's it for this week. Until next time, Keep Buttpluggin'!
