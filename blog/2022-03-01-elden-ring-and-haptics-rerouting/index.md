title: "Elden Ring And Haptics Rerouting"
date: 2022-03-01
---The weekly update would consist of one project this week, so I'll just post the project itself.

 I managed to reroute Elden Ring rumble to sex toys. This involved using USBPcap, which is a pretty wildly unsafe way to do things, but it did the job.

There's video of the project at

I've written a post on how *all* of my rerouting projects worked, from the original SeXBox all the way through to Elden Ring, which is the post above. It has all of the relevant links at videos.

Was nice to do a shitpost project again. Anyways, back to the buttplug mines. Hopefully more library updates next week.
