Dear god, if I never talk about web browsers again it will be too soon.Too bad that's my dayjob. >.>

Was at a dayjob meetup all week, so not much got done in terms of development on Buttplug. I mentioned this might be happening in the update last week, so no real surprises there.

However, I've got some new ideas for web based interaction via WebExtensions that I'm going to be poking at, that I think may improve how Buttplug works with movie sync in web browsers and on sites outside of syncydink. More on that soon hopefully.

Our server move is 98% done, now down to fixing some links to old domains and we should be good for a while. I'll hopefully be getting this finalized over the upcoming weekend.
