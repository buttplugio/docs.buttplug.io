Buttplug Rust is actually kinda sorta maybe a thing now!

The Client API has been implemented in Rust, using the new async/await system. It seems to be working pretty well so far, though I haven't gotten to do a ton of testing yet. Now that the release is out, I'm hoping to start testing FFI for writing a C# layer on top of it (which would then mean hopefully simple Unity support!), as well as starting to implement the Server side in it.

Exciting times ahead!
