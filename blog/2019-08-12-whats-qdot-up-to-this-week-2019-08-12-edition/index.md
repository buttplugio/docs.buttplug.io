Writing tweets that should really be blog posts, apparently.

# Intiface/Buttplug/Etc
Nothing to say here. No code written this week. New job is throwing a lot at me right now and I think my brain needed a break, which is why I basically played through the whole of Hollow Knight in the span of a week. Hopefully recovered and back to it soon.

Good news is, I'm learnin' lots about ML, so maybe that knowledge will end up around here soon. Who wants to do linear regression about sex?

# Writing
I apparently miss blogging, though.

For those of you not following the Buttplug twitter account, here's a quick catch-up.

Defcon, the security conference, was last week. There were 2 sex tech presentations! 

The first one was Friday, a panel on Cyber Sexurity (ow ow ow it even hurts to type that) with awesome people from SexTechSpace ([https://www.sextechspace.com/),](https://www.sextechspace.com/),) Lora DeCarlo, and BadAssArmy. I somehow was not even aware this was happening?

So most of my content was about the one that I did know about. On Sunday, a console hacker presented a really interested exploit chain involving Lovense toys. Basically, there's ways to reflash both the firmware of a Lovense toy, AND run code on the lovense dongle, AND cause remote execution in the Lovense desktop app. It's pretty impressive (and the app part has been patched at least, so the exploit chain is partially broken).

Slides are here:

The slides are rather technical, so if people would like a gentler explanation of what's going on in the hack versus lots of memory diagrams and acronyms, please comment on this post and if enough people are interested, I'll write up an Patreon-Exclusive explainer. :)

Anyways, I was rather worried that someone was using sex toys for yet another FUD talk, but honestly, this talk was in depth enough on the tech side that it didn't really use sex toys as a crutch. It really did need the specific product for the presentation, which just so happened to be a buttplug.

However, I did see lots of "WHY DOES THIS EVEN EXIST DOWN WITH IOT" replies, so I wrote up an incredibly long thread on how the current Lovense technology stack came to be:

It's been getting some fairly good feedback. 

So far, the media has been fairly quiet on the talk as a whole, which is a little surprising, they usually jump right on this stuff.

Really though, twitter is a horrible place for this kind of long form writing, so I'm hoping to get back to having an actual blog soon too. Whether that will be on Metafetish is up in the air (playing around with some ideas for pivoting Metafetish a little, may talk about this next week), but hopefully it'll be somewhere, because dividing thoughts into 280 characters sucks.

Anyways, that's it for this week. Until next week, keep Buttpluggin'!
