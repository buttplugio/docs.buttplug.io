I wish I had another Butt Saber to talk about here but nope, we're back to library updates.

I haven't even gotten to finish writing Butt Saber yet. :(

But! Having just finished the Erostek ET-312 protocol fixes in Buttplug C# 0.4.0 alpha this evening, we're close to getting that shipped. We're down to 1-2 more issues, then hopefully shipping that this week and getting back to work on our new Server software to replace the old Buttplug Server. Now that Buttplug C# can load configuration files, this will make updating devices much easier, as well as opening up new ways for people to implement their own hardware to use buttplug. Exciting times!

Other than that, the discord has been getting busier lately, with new people showing up and working on things with Buttplug. Hoping to see some new applications showing up soon.

Anyways, this has been a bit of a non-update this time around 'cause we're in that awkward pre-release stage, but hopefully more news soon!

Keep Buttpluggin',
