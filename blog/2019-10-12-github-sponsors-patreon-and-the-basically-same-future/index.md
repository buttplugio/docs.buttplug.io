tl;dr: I'm now using 2 funding platforms, but there will be no fundamental changes due to this. Unless you want the gritty details of what it's like to be a creator with multiple patron streams, you can skip this post. :)

For anyone that follows me on twitter, you may've noticed that I was accepted to the Github Sponsors program. Github Sponsors is basically Patreon with a bit more of a development/corporate/open source focus.

I just wanted everyone to know that nothing will be changing on this patreon, outside of the tier levels. I discussed that topic here back in July, and I'll be aligning the patreon levels with what I now have on Github at some point in the future, but that shouldn't affect anyone already signed up here.

I'll still be advertising support for my projects through both Patreon and Github sponsorships, though admittedly I'll be marketing the Github side a bit harder at first because Github provides $5000 in matching funds for your first year of sponsorships, and that's a lot of Buttplugs.

In the future, I see the divide working this way:

- Patreon will most likely be funding from users of applications, fans of my youtube channel, etc... It'll be handy for non-github-using people.

- Github will become where I get money from developers I'm supporting, do consulting, etc... Basically a good way to get funding from people who already have github accounts, but having non-coders sign up to github would be silly.

Both of these demographics are equally important and I won't be dropping one or the other. In fact the content will basically be mirrored between the two places, which is more work for me than anything. :)

If you have any questions or concerns (or also just have questions about how running these kinda services works), please feel free to message me directly. Just want to keep everything as transparent as possible.
