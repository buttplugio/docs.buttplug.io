title: Standalone Haptic Playback And Toy Simulator In Syncydink

In lieu of video recording, I guess my brain decided it wasn't done futzing with web programming. I ended up making improvements to the syncydink haptics timeline viewer, and added a toy simulator with graphics by funjack (of golaunch/launchcontrol/funscript fame). Now you can see how a toy will react to a video or haptic script, even if you don't have the toy handy!Also, if you just want to play a script without a movie, that's doable. If you load a haptic script, then choose "Show timeline", there's now a play/pause button on the bottom of the timeline bar. This will play the script without needing a movie loaded. If you /do/ have a movie loaded, the playhead in the haptic timeline can now control movie position, and vice versa.

The other buttons there are for looping, and locking the timeline. Unlocking the timeline will let you edit/add/remove points, which will be part of the upcoming encoding feature. Right now, it's mostly for show.
