As the weekly updates drift farther from the date they're supposed to be on...This week has mostly been working with some other developers on what may end up being our first full Unity integration! I'm not sure how this will look going forward, but I've got high hopes, since Unity support remains our #1 requested feature.

The work here was mostly adding some small features like the ability to inflate/deflate Lovense Max toys, and to run the Buttplug Server on windows without a GUI. Hopefully these features will prove useful for others too.

Other than that, life has gotten in the way of working on Syncydink and more videos the past week or two, but that's hopefully clearing up now. Once I can sort the gigantic pile of sex toys on my filming desk (my attempt at "cleaning my workspace"), that should help quite a bit.
