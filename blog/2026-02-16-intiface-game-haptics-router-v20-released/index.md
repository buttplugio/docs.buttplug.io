[Intiface Game Haptics Router v20 is live!](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-game-haptics-router/releases/tag/v20)

First update in 18 months! Hopefully the first one that doesn't register as a virus/malware in... several years!

I removed process finding code that opened live processes and list their library bindings. Windows hated that lol.
