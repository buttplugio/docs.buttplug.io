It happened! It finally happened! 3.5 years of work, now released!

https://github.com/intiface/intiface-central/releases/tag/v3.0.0%2B36

Intiface Central v3 and Buttplug Rust v10 are out! This also includes new versions of Buttplug C#, Python (using the old "buttplug" pypi project!), Javascript/Typescript, and Dart!

There's a LOT that's come out today, which I'm going to be spending the rest of the week writing a blogpost or 3 about. I'll post about those when they're ready.

Please let me know (via one of the links on the bottom of this page) if you have any issues. Looking forward to implementing new stuff soon finally!
