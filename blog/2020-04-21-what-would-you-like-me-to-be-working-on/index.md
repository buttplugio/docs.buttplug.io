It's been a while since I've asked this and I'm curious whether my plans line up with what others are looking for from my work.

I'm running this poll over on twitter right now too ([https://twitter.com/buttplugio/status/1252769543560196096](https://twitter.com/buttplugio/status/1252769543560196096)), but since y'all give me money I might actually listen to the results here. :)

I definitely have some feelings on what I should be working on, but I'll reserve those for after the poll.

If you'd like to point out something specific, you can leave a reply to this poll, or feel free to message me with it directly.

Project Docs: dev guide, buttplug-rs book, stpihkal
