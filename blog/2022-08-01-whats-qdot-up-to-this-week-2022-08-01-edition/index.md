DONE! SORTA!

# Buttplug
Buttplug v6 is feature complete! I got sensor messages in over the weekend, and can now relay pressure and battery using them! This is a huge step forward for the library, as now we can provide information from toys that have capabilities for it.

<!--truncate-->

For v6.0.0, this will probably just end up being a few pelvic floor exercisers, and maybe some buttons on some devices, as well as the ability to get battery levels and now RSSI from bluetooth (hopefully, that's a weird one). We'll be quickly growing those capabilities in patch versions later on though.

Now the work is on to get things tested, cleaned up, and released! Dev cycle ran WAY too long on this version (8 months >.>) so I'm very much looking forward to getting this out.

# Intiface Central
Intiface Central (what used to be known as Intiface Desktop, now written in Flutter and no longer just on desktop) is up and running on Desktop AND Android! It should also work on iOS, I just haven't had a chance to set that up yet. 

Now, just because it's up and running doesn't mean it does much. It can bring up the Buttplug Server and that's about it at the moment. There's a lot of UI work left to do, but I plan on releasing betas with minimal features as soon as possible so y'all can start trying toy connections on your phones! This will be a huge deal for compatibility.

# Everything Else
You may have heard about the upheaval in VRChat last week. There's LOTS of churn about toy access in VR virtual worlds right now thanks to that. I'm trying to keep up to date lists of every available plugin for VRC/ChilloutVR/neos/god knows what else in [https://awesome.buttplug.io](https://awesome.buttplug.io)

That's it for this week. Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
