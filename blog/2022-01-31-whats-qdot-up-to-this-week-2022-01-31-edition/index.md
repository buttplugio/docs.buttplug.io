v6 begins.

### Buttplug
Finally started Buttplug v6. First off: Step Ranges.

<!--truncate-->

This is a fancy term for saying "limit how fast/far your toy can go". As we're looking at implementing things like fucking machines in this version of the library, we'll need limiters. However, this will also be handy for things like strokers, if you don't want them to go past a certain point.

I've also started work on the new LevelCmd, which is what will allow us to easily extend to oscillation, inflation, etc without having to do massive revisions of the library every time. It's won't be a panacea, but it'll definitely be better than our current situation.

### Intiface Desktop
Intiface Desktop Beta 2 is out! Seems to be pretty solid so far, for all... 12 people who've downloaded it.

I'm burnt as hell on GUI programming, so I'm taking some time to work on Buttplug while I see how this beta goes. The next version of Desktop will probably be both boring and important, as it'll mostly be cleaning up places where things could crash on error, and providing better ways for users to receive errors and get help (possibly automated help!). After that's done, we'll probably be ready for release.

Oh and for Mac/Linux users, getting the rest of the platform compat up is the next step. There should be Beta 2 Mac/Linux versions soon.

### Everything Else

 - I've got some new Hismith hardware coming in to test, as they also make a stroker. Who knew! (IOSTIndex knew :| )

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
