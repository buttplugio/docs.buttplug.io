No alpha survives first contact with users.

New version is attached.

So it turns out the engine update system was downloading an older engine that doesn't work with this build of desktop (but I wasn't seeing it because I set different engine repos for debug/release. Oops.). 

For now, I've just removed the ability to get any updates, which isn't really needed at this point anyways because we're in Alpha 3.

Apologies for the multiple emails, hopefully this is it for at least the night.
