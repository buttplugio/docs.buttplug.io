title: "What's qDot Up To This Week? (2018-07-13 Edition)"

A rather quiet week due to some personal stuff getting in the way, but still got some work done!Youtube Embeds are still in beta on Syncydink. The goal here is to provide scripts alongside Buttpluggin' With qDot videos, so when my toys vibrate in videos, yours can too! This means I've gotta build recording features into our apps, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem.

With that in mind, I'm also working on making my recording setup a little easier to work with. Editing is usually the #1 time sink when making youtube videos, so I'm trying to see how much composition and one-shot recording I can do to maybe crank out videos like the Will It Buttplug series faster. This isn't gonna work for everything, as my more complicated videos will still require multiple cameras and editing work, but it's worth a shot.

Also trying to actually get a list of hardware we support on the website! Wild to think the project has been running for 16 months with no easily-accessible list of what hardware it works with. Bit of an oversight there. >.>

The plan for the moment is to continue on improving Playground and Syncydink. Unity is being worked out slowly too, and over on the discord, we've got some Twine developers exercising our Twine library to make sex toy interaction with Twine games. Lots of exciting stuff on the way!
