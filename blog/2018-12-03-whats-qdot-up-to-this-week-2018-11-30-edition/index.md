The end of the maintenance period is in sight! I think! Maybe!buttplug-js 0.9.0 went out this weekend, putting the JS codebase in line with Buttplug C#, which now means I can hopefully start on a new version of the Buttplug Developer Guide (the document I'd like to be able to point new developers to on how to use this project) with reasonable expectations of the C#/JS APIs looking mostly the same. This also means I can move on to upgrading the C# and JS user applications (Server, GVR, Syncydink, Playground, etc...), and maybe, just maybe, working on something new.

Of course, I'm hemorrhaging Patreon members for reasons I'm not real sure of (I figure probably boredom at the months of my yak-shaving the library), so thanks to those of you still sticking with me. I'd really like to spend December getting more hardware support in, getting applications up to date, and figuring out some new small projects to work on that won't eat months.

Hope everyone is braced for whatever holidays you may have to endure.
