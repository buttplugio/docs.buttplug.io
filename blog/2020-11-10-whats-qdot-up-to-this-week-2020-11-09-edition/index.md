Ugh. Combination of health issues and dayjob really slowing things down, but...

# Buttplug
Now in the home stretch for getting Buttplug to v1. This mostly involves porting Playground, Syncydink, and the GHR to their new respective base libraries. This is taking a while as I'm also trying to hammer out what the surface API should look like before rolling to major version updates.

<!--truncate-->

Playground has a WASM version up at

[https://beta.playground.buttplug.world](https://beta.playground.buttplug.world)

Which seems to work ok, and can access the Kiiroo Keon from the browser now!

# Youtube
A couple of weeks ago now, I posted a teardown of the single use Satisfyer sex toy. It went over pretty well, so after that I filmed an unboxing of the Kiiroo Keon, and a quick overview of the OSR-2. Those are in editing now, hopefully out sometime soon, just trying to balance that work against the code work and dayjob.

# Other Stuff
I have some new toys on the way, including an Edge-o-matic (a new, upgraded Nogasm) as well as some silly stuff from Ali Express for more teardown videos.

That's it for now. Mostly trying to tread water here, hopefully more exciting things soon.

Until next week, keep buttpluggin'!
