Just posted a new Dev Log on the blog! Now that we've got releases out, going to try to get back into a better writing cadence so we're not developing in a black hole.Right now, we're in the middle of the black hole, try to develop *out *of it. Buttplug was in development for so long and has so little documentation that it's hard for users to figure out what to use where, and what works on what platforms. This became very evident when I posted about syncydink on a couple of forums over the weekend and was met with a lot of either silence or "???" in response. I'm going to be spending the next while trying to fix that somehow. This may end up in me begging for tech writing help on twitter. :)
