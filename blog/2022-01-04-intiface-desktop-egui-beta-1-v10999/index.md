---Next version is ready to go! Tons of updates and bugfixes since the alphas last week. Still needs basic documentation and all that, but the repo is now public, and updates should work too! (You'll have to manually update the application on new versions but it'll prompt you to do so)

As always, if you decide to check this out, please let me know any feedback you have!
