Surviving. Barely.SLSA in Toronto went great. It was my first humanities conferences and I only barely embarrassed myself like, 3 or 4 times, max. I'll be doing a youtube version soon, not that the information will be new to anyone here.

Since I got back, I've mostly been back to patching software. Both Buttplug C# and JS got point releases this week to fix yet another schema issue that new versions of JSON schema parsers seem to be picking up now. Yay more strictness, boo having it wrong in the first place.

I've now moved to working on the JS libraries again, once again trying to get them in line with where the C# ended up. This should be far less work than the C# library was, like, weeks, not months. After that, plan is to bring the C# GUI applications up to date, then playground/syncydink, then maybe, god, MAYBE do something new, as this year has been a serious grind on just getting things I've already done working right.

In other news, I started testing out JoyFunScripter, a free (tho not open source) movie synchronization script builder that showed up on RealTouchScripts a while ago: [http://www.realtouchscripts.com/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=6565](http://www.realtouchscripts.com/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=6565)

It's pretty neat! Does a lot of stuff I was/am hoping to do in Syncydink, and the best part is they're testing all sorts of encoding mechanisms, which means I can skip over what they've done that hasn't worked out.

I definitely recommend checking it out, as there's a lot of interesting interfaces in the program. Really exciting to see development like this happening.

That's it for now. Hope everyone that was having holidays had good ones.
