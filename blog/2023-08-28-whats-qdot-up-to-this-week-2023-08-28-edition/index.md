I finally got fed up with the logging panel and have now rebuilt it. It's now much more compact, easier to see more messages (especially on mobile), and we should have log/crash reporting in again too! This will be massively helpful for support in the future.

Annnnnnnnd that's it. Life continues to be rough due to personal/medical issues, but managing to get stuff done here and there.

Until next time, keep buttpluggin'!
