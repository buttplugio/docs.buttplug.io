So maybe you're wondering why I started a patreon now, well after that bandwagon has already set down the highway at full speed? Like I said in the campaign description, there's a lot of toys coming out now. I really want to reverse engineer all of them so I can continue my plans for world domination via genital manipulation robots. However, it's getting kinda spendy to keep buying stuff myself. For instance, I dropped $600 on the ET-312 last year, and while we've gotten a HUGE amount of reversing milage out of that (more on that in a later post), that was still super spendy.

Here's my toy purchasing list at the moment:

- SayberX

- Rends Vorze A10 Cyclone

- Kiiroo Launch

- Vibratissimo Duo

- Whatever the OhMiBod bluetooth toy is

- eJaculator when it comes out

And I'm sure there's more toys on the way. The plan for the moment is to try to burn through that list, get as many things bought and reversed as possible, and get [https://buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io) into at least alpha release so I can start integrating what I've reversed there.

While I'll really be shocked if I make enough money from Patreon to fully fund any of these toys completely, it's nice to know there's people out there interested enough to put money toward this. In 13 years of doing this, I've really not made very much cash, mainly because I've never tried. This is a hobby, not a job. There's never been advertising on Metafetish, and unless a company buys the VIP status thing, there probably never will be (and even if they do, I'll try to keep it interesting).

So, thanks for donating. Now to see where this goes.
