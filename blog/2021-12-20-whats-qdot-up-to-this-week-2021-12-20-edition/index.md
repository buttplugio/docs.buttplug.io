So damn close...

### Buttplug
Was planning on getting Intiface Desktop Alpha out over the weekend, but unfortunately bugs in Buttplug took precedent. I fixed some issues with Satisfyer toys, as well as trying to fix some problems with the ScanningFinished message that... didn't really fix anything so I may be removing that, though it's going to make WebBluetooth weird, so we'll see what happens.

Otherwise, I'm really hoping we're getting close to me being able to work on Buttplug v6, which will allow for control of things like the Lovense Max Air Bladder, Hismith Fucking Machines, etc... It's not a huge change to the code, but it'll be the first update to our message spec in 3 years, so it's gonna take some planning.

### Intiface Desktop Rust
We're now down to the implementation of the First Run Experience in the new version of Intiface Desktop, then it should be ready to go. I'd like to say this'll happen this week, but we'll see.

### **Youtube**
Finally getting more youtube videos out! Did a very quick Bluetooth Buttplug comparison video last week, and this week I'm hoping to finish up editing the diamo modification video and will get that posted.

### Everything Else

 - There's now a mod for Our Apartment ([https://momoirosoft.itch.io/our-apartment)](https://momoirosoft.itch.io/our-apartment)) via the Love Machine BepInEx mod ([https://github.com/Sauceke/BepInEx.LoveMachine)!](https://github.com/Sauceke/BepInEx.LoveMachine)!)
 - Buttplug is apparently also being used in VRHot now! I hadn't even heard of this game before they announced buttplug support. Always interesting when that happens. [https://www.vr-hot.com/](https://www.vr-hot.com/)

Anyways, that's it for this week. Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
