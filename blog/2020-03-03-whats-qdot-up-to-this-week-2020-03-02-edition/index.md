Watching all of my speaking gigs disappear.

# Travel (Or Not)
So ignore all of those "come see me at OOOHack/GDC!" posts I was making. I ended up having to cancel on OOOHack in Chicago last weekend due to life just kinda sucking right now, and GDC has been cancelled. I'll be submitting a filmed version of my talk to GDC, so it'll be up on GDC Vault, and I'll probably post it to YouTube (and therefore you'll see it here first!).

# Buttplug
With all of that out of the way, I've had some time to get back to working on Buttplug. The goal is still to get buttplug-rs to a point of replacing intiface-cli-csharp/intiface-cli-node in Intiface Desktop, and that's going pretty well. Been doing a lot of work to bring up testing interfaces, so we can know that we're maybe actually doing the right thing some of the time. Also starting to work on backward compatibility, one of the most important parts of the system, since we want to keep applications that use Buttplug working until the End Of Time (Or Until I Get Sick Of Supporting Them).

# Everything Else
I ordered a 3D printer (A Prusa i3 MK3)! I've had enough people coming to me with neat 3D printed projects (some for integration with Buttplug) and I've felt bad about having to constantly ask people to print stuff for me.

I'll be printing more nogasm parts, there's a ESP32 vibrator someone has been working on that I wanna try making, and also planning on building an OSR2+ ([https://patreon.com/tempestvr).](https://patreon.com/tempestvr).)

If there's any projects you'd like to see build on my YouTube channel, lemme know.

That's it for now. Hoping that things will stay calm and I can ramp back up on work (and therefore have more newsletter content)!

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
