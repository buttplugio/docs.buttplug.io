After taking a break this past long weekend (helped immensely with some of the twinges of burnout I was getting), I'm back at it on trying to get a minimal application working for Buttplug using C# and Typescript. I just posted a full update on Metafetish at[https://www.metafetish.com/2017/05/31/metafetish-dev-log--week-of-20170529/](https://www.metafetish.com/2017/05/31/metafetish-dev-log--week-of-20170529/)

 Still getting lots of contact about the project from random places, the scattered interest is nice. Just hoping I haven't overhyped a bit with how long implementation is taking.
