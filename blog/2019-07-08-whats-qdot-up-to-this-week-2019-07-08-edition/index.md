Dear god why do people keep coming to me with interesting projects when I have so much boring work to do!

### Buttplug
Anyways let's start with the boring. The library work.

<!--truncate-->

For the core libraries, I put out Buttplug C# 0.4.7 last week. Big feature there was the Xamarin module which now gives us the possibility of Android/iOS apps. There was also some toy additions and fixes (Cyclone SA should work again!) and a few development things (you can build from source zips again and don't require the full git repo). That was also released as intiface-cli-csharp 0.4.7, so if you're running Intiface Desktop on windows you probably got an update notification for that.

On the JS side, I rewrote the vue-buttplug-material-component to make life easier on all of us. The code is now much simpler, and also has a better UI that doesn't require users to know all of their IP addresses! Which leads us to...

### Applications (Playground, Syncydink, Tutorial, etc...)
The all new Playground!

[https://playground.buttplug.world](https://playground.buttplug.world)

This uses the new connector widget as well as getting a slight usability overhaul. 

I'll be porting Syncydink to this next.

Also, I'm rebuilding the tutorial from scratch because it has been broken for a while now, which has new users bouncing off Buttplug completely. This is now my top priority, assuming other shiny things stop showing up, like...

### VAMLaunch
As you probably saw from the multiple youtube/pornhub video posts... This past 4 day weekend was going to be spent on the aforementioned tutorial and widget work, but then VAMLaunch showed up on Friday and completely blew my schedule. I ripped the GUI and installer from GHR to help VAMLaunch have a bit more polish than just having a command line with a readline interface, and working with Zengineer (the VAMLaunch author) was a great experience. I even got *2* demo videos done in a weekend! I'm really glad VAM finally has hardware support and was happy to help out to make it better, as people have been asking me about it for over a year and it was just never gonna happen for me due to lack of time.

I'm hoping to get back to the tutorial and syncydink updates this week, then finish out buttplug-py and maybe get a Intiface Desktop revision out next week.

### Patreon Tiers
I mentioned last month that there would be patreon tier updates. I'm still planning on doing that, but at this rate it may be August now.

That's it for now. Until next week, keep buttpluggin'!
