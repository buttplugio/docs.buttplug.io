I've been getting requests to get hardware support into VirtAMate ([https://patreon.com/meshvr)](https://patreon.com/meshvr)) for a long time, but it's a complicated program with a lot going on, so I've never really gotten a foothold to figure out how to do that.

Luckily, someone else did!

I've been working with the VAMLaunch creator over the past couple of days to get their device system ported to Buttplug, as well as adding a GUI, installer, and other nice polish stuff around their VAM scripts. It all works rather well!

Sorry about this video not being a pre-release, but I was running on other people's deadlines this time so it was an ASAP sorta thing (which you can tell by the ad-lib'd video where I make "youtube-safe" jokes no less than 10 times, heh.).
