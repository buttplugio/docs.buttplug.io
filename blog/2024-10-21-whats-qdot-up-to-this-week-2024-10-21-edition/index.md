Unemployment! Unless you count my own company, too bad that doesn't pay very well.

# Life
So yeah, the startup where I worked as a dayjob disappeared 2 weeks ago.

<!--truncate-->

Like, literally just poofed out of existence due to lack of money.

It sucks, but such is life in the startup game.

Thanks to everyone who donates to the project, as, well, now it *really* matters since it's my only income.

Good news is, there seems to be a lot of opportunities out there for engineers at my level right now. Bad news is, finding them is gonna take a while and some work, so I have no clue what my schedule look like for the foreseeable future. I'm going to hopefully spend more time work on Buttplug, Intiface, the twitch streams, etc while I can, because honestly I like having the time to do so. Just wish it wasn't quite so abrupt.

# Buttplug and Intiface
The newest release of Intiface Central has been out for a little over a week now, and seems to be working pretty well. I got the Solace Pro linear movement code in, which has made many people happy (or at least, I'm guessing they're happy, they're at least not yelling at me anymore).

I'm honestly not sure what's up next for Buttplug and Intiface. This isn't to say that there isn't a ton to do, as I very badly need to get the v4 spec scoped and done (the work is a good bit done as is, a lot of it shipped in the past couple of Intiface versions), Intiface UI is a mess that could use cleanup, etc. I just need to sit down and roadmap a few things to figure out what comes next.

Outside of that, I also very much need to work on documentation for buttplug. I'm getting more and more interest from developers, who are then running headlong into a wall when they realize there isn't a lot of info about the different command messages and what you can do with them. I think a couple of days spent writing in-depth docs for ScalarCmd/LinearCmd could make a pretty big difference. 

# Everything Else

- Twitch Streaming was going great until that whole unemployment thing! I was getting in 2-3 streams a week, though still hadn't really been able to get a schedule going yet. Then a combo of company disappear and going to BLFC completely blew my schedule. I've just finished up a new streaming related Buttplug project that I'm pretty excited about and will be showing later this week, most likely Wednesday afternoon. Once I get that planned, I'll post an event notification here and on social media.

- In addition to the aforementioned documentation, I'm gonna see about getting more blog posts done. I've got a lot of writing I'd been meaning to do about Buttplug architecture, streaming as a warmup for presenting info on the project, etc...

That's it for now. Until next time, Keep Buttpluggin'!
