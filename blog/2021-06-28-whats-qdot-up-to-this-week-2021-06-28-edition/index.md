A boring but somewhat productive week in the Buttplug world...

### Buttplug
Right now most of the work in Buttplug is actually slightly lower than Buttplug itself. I'm working with some other developers to get the new Bluetooth LE library in, which allows me to cut about 50% of the bluetooth code out of the server, as well as making things work far better on macOS. It'll also possibly open the way for iOS/Android usage. Unfortunately things are stuck on Linux right now, where everything breaks horribly. Hoping to have that shored up in the next week or two so we can get this out.

### Applications
Intiface Desktop 23 was released a little over a week ago, after a major bug in v21 caused updates to break. I am *hoping* most people are finding ways to update to it, but due to the lack of tracking and metrics, it's a bit hard to tell.

As I've probably said a million times before, I really need to figure out better support and logging on Intiface Desktop. We're getting enough users now that problems are starting to repeat often, but getting to the bottom of those issues requires a ton of discussion on discord, when really it should just be "user hits button, developers get system layout and relevant logs".

I'm also working on taking the device panel UI and turning that into a new version of Buttplug Playground, as playground itself has been horribly broken for months and just needs an overhaul anyways.

### SFW Content - New Channels/Patreon
There's a bit of a change coming to how I handle my patreons and content. For the past 4 years, I've only had one patreon, youtube channel, etc, all focused on Buttplug. However, a lot of the subject matter around that isn't specifically NSFW, it just ends up being so when I add sex toys. In order to grow my audience and not cordon off content that's not explicitly sexual, I've now created a new Youtube Channel and related Patreon, known as the Poor Life Choices Network.

Right now this will mostly be for explaining some of the VR work I've been doing in SFW contexts, even though most of it still ends in Buttplug at one point or another, heh. I'll also be using this to talk about things like the internals of the Game Haptics Router, which I'm currently forking for non-adult haptics hardware like the bHaptics and OWO vests. Once again, an originally Buttplug focused technology, but talking about the methods used in it doesn't really require that context.

All that said, this doesn't mean I'm stopping work on Buttplug or adult content. It just gives me a way to take some of the technology created for the project and show it off to a larger audience without having to worry about getting removed from searches, banned from services, etc. I'll still be working as hard as ever here, and as a member of this patreon you'll still get most of the perks of the PLC patreon, since a lot of the work overlaps. I just won't be mentioning the buttplugs part of it on PLC.

That's it for now. Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
