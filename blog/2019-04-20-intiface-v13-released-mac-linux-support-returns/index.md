date: 2019-04-20

After much wailing and gnashing of teeth, I got Mac/Linux support back into Intiface. MacOS seems to work fine, Linux takes a little extra work (see the README: [https://github.com/intiface/intiface-desktop](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-desktop)#linux-issues).

Releases for all platforms can be downloaded at

[https://github.com/intiface/intiface-desktop/releases/tag/v13.0.0](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-desktop/releases/tag/v13.0.0)

Now that I've got all the platforms building and basically sort of working, time to add some new features (oh and probably finish the UI since there's things that are still missing, like the explanation of cert setup, and the whole about page, etc...)
