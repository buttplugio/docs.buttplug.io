A couple of days late, but I'll blame that on the Steam sale selling me Metal Gear Solid 5 for cheap and getting me addicted to it. Sure.*attaches fulton extraction device to buttplugs*

Anyways, busy week around Buttplug Labs before that! Finally got the new version of Syncydink out after 7 months of quiet. I'm now working on doing rolling releases of it with smaller features, since that overhaul took so long.

Getting web based encoding up and running is the next big deal, which is mostly down to me remembering how d3 (the visualization library I used to build the timeline/graphs) works, and how our data interacts with it. It's a super complex library, but hopefully I can get everything cobbled together enough to spit out a funscript file.

Would also like to get basic documentation and changelogs built into the playground and syncydink apps, as so far it's been quite difficult for anyone not me to figure out when things were updated, how they work, etc...

I just got in a stack of toys from Aliexpress, including the Bluetooth Speaker Onahole I posted yesterday. I have a lot of catching up to do on toy documentation and implementation!

That's it for now, back to work!
