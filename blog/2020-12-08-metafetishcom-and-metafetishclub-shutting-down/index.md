title: Metafetishcom And Metafetishclub Shutting Down
date: 2020-12-08

In my continuing goal of trying to maintain less zombie brands, I'm finally shutting down the Metafetish brand to focus on Buttplug/Intiface.

For metafetish.com, this doesn't mean much. Blog hasn't been updated in years, and I'm getting a new blog for Nonpolynomial that I'll be doing long form posts too. I also just have no interest to be a general sex toy blogger anymore. I've kinda got a different perspective than when I started Slashdong/Metafetish, and my needs have changed with that. The blog itself will stay up on the domain in perpetuity (don't wanna link rot it), though with the static engine it used, it's also up and indexed on internet archive until whenever.

The forums at metafetish.club will be live until Jan 1 2021, at which point I'll set them read-only. The info on them is either really old stuff about Buttplug, or MK312 tech stuff that needs to move elsewhere (somewhere managed by someone actively involved in the scene, because I'm also extremely done with that project), so it's not a huge loss.

Anyways, not much change here. Buttplug/Intiface are still things, the youtube channel will continue, and I'll announce the new blog in the next week or so, which will have a heavier tech focus (i.e. incredibly dense programming posts because if I'm gonna level up in the Rust community that's how you grind).
