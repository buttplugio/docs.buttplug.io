Another week of Buttpluggin' updates!

# Stickers
Ok, well, I put out a call for stickers as tier rewards, and... 8 people replied! So that's less than I was planning on, heh.

<!--truncate-->

For those that did update your addresses, thanks. For those that haven't yet and are on the $3 or higher tier:

- Yes I will ship stickers internationally. No it will not cost you extra.

- If you don't want to put your mailing address into your Patreon account, you can either message me with it, or just email it (kyle@nonpolynomial.com) or DM it to me on twitter ([https://twitter.com/qdot)](https://twitter.com/qdot)) or something. 

- For those of you who are on the $1 tier but have donated for 3 months or more, you're gonna have to send me your address manually using one of the above methods.

- If you haven't entered your address because you're just not interested in tier rewards, that's also fine, please continue ignoring this. :)

I'm probably going to print another round of stickers soon. May post a poll on what stickers patrons would like, 'cause I've got way too many options as is.

# Intiface
Now that I'm done with presentation and workshop preparation, I'm back to working on Intiface. 

The good news is, my code signing certificate came through, so now all of my Windows binaries and nuget packages are code-signed! Basically this just means that it's harder to spoof them. Not that I really plan on people doing that, but with the context of Buttplug, it's something nice to have covered anyways.

Intiface Desktop is now at v2, but I'm still not sure I'd recommend running it yet unless you like being on the absolute questionable-sanity bleeding edge of things. It only works on Windows at the moment (Linux support should be fixed again soon, Mac is... gonna take work, due to more code signing issues with node.), but it does at least basically sorta kinda work. I'm still hammering out basic UI problems right now, so there's lots of things that can lock up UI wise. Now that all of the build crap is done, it's coming along pretty fast though. Once I feel it's like, actually usable, I'll be sending out a post specifically telling people to start banging on it.

# Buttplug
Buttplug is also getting updates as Intiface gets built. Just released a new version of the C# library with more LiBo hardware support, as well as some fixes to rather serious bugs involving device reconnection. Javascript will hopefully get some catch-up patches soon, I just want to get Intiface shipping on at least one platform first.

# Possible New Exciting Hardware Soon!
A really neat sex tech hardware project I've been watching for a couple of years is finally coming to fruition. I'm hoping I'll have more to say on this in the next few weeks, but for now teasers are all I've got. :)

# Everything Else
- I actually updated Playground right before Pittsburgh, it's now running on Buttplug 0.11, which supported the hardware I was using in the workshop there.

- Once Intiface Desktop is shipping (aiming for end of April for all platforms running at least something on Electron), hoping to update Syncydink, Playground, and the components they use. Those were written in the early days of the project, and really need an upgrade

- Kinda not sure what to do about Metafetish these days. I have like zero time to write at the moment. I'm also not really getting information out efficiently, so blogging seems like it'd be a good idea. Can we add 6-8 more hours to the day?

- I have a pile of Youtube videos I'd also like to get started on, but see prior comment.

That's it for now. Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
