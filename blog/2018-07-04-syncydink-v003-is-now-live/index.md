---May god have mercy on us all.Syncydink v0.0.3 is now live, making it the first major update of Syncydink since December 2017. There's still not much in the way of new features, as most of this was cleanup and package updates, but development should be much simpler from now on since the mess that was Video Modes is gone.

I've also switched out the opening page with a card that shows slightly more info. In the coming days, this will fill out some to actually include documentation on how to use the player, as well as news and updates, so users won't have to guess about when the last time I changed things was.

If you have any problems or issues, please let me know.

For those that are about to ask when I'm going to get back to working on the encoder part and possibly add gamepad encoding or something, the answer is "now, hopefully".
