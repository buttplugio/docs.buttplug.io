Well I've got one hell of a code katamari going on here.Buttplug C# 0.3.0 continues to trudge slowly toward release, gaining more features and fixes all the time. Last week was mostly spend hammering the Serial Port support into a better state, so we can support something other than the Erostek ET-312B. This will include:

- EStim System 2b

<!--truncate-->

- Erostek ET-232

- Lovense USB Keys

- Vorze USB Keys

As well as machines people are building themselves, which will be super exciting!

Now I'm hopefully down to bug fixes, writing more tests, and code cleanup before pushing this out into the world and getting on with life.
