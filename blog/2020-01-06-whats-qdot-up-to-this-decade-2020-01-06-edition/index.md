Same thing we do every decade, Pinky. Try to buttplug the world.

### Buttplug
Same shit, different year.

<!--truncate-->

Development on buttplug-rs continues, and is going well. As of this past weekend, I can now build a single rust executable with the client/server API that will control bluetooth toys. This is a very specific flow so I've still got a lot of work to do, but it's the first end-to-end test of the new code, so I'm super excited about that.

Other developers on Discord are starting to look at the code, and there may be some protocol work being done by someone who is not me soon. I'm still trying to get a full, working server out of this, so I've got a ton of small things to implement or fix (like, say, being able to detect when devices disconnect >.> ), as well as some Large Things (like implementing a CoreBluetooth backend for MacOS so buttplug-rs can become the single engine behind all 3 platforms in intiface desktop).

Times continue to be exciting though! Really looking forward to being able to centralize on this across all of our platforms and not have to implement everything multiple times. :D

### Upcoming Travel/Speaking Engagements
For anyone in the Bay Area, I'm part of a sex tech panel at OutInTech San Francisco on February 12th. More info on that soon.

I'll be speaking and mentoring at OOOHack in Chicago in late February: [http://commiserate.life/sthack](http://commiserate.life/sthack)

I'm also speaking at GDC in March: [https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/sexy-microtalks-designing-sex-and-emotions/868910](https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/sexy-microtalks-designing-sex-and-emotions/868910)

That's it for now.

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
