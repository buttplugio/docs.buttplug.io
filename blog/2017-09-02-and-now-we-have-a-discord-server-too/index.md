Yes ok I may have a slight chat protocol hoarding problem.Invite Link: [https://discord.gg/BGNjpbf](https://discord.gg/BGNjpbf)

For Patrons: If you join the discord and would like to have the special Patron role, just message me and I'll get that set up.

I've been doing a lot of support for video encoding lately, and a lot of contact for that has been through skype and discord. I figured I'd set up yet another chat outpost on Discord, hoping the people I've been helping there can help each other too. This means we now have:

- Discourse Message Boards at [http://metafetish.club](http://metafetish.club)

- Slack Instance (mostly developers/tech/engineering) at [https://metafetish.slack.com,](https://metafetish.slack.com,) message me for an Invite

- Discord at [https://discord.gg/BGNjpbf,](https://discord.gg/BGNjpbf,) just come on in

- Unofficial Telegram that I'm not actually in but has been surprisingly on topic lately (people doing 3d printing and small electronics builds for sex toys) at [http://telegram.me/metafetish](http://telegram.me/metafetish)

Not an ideal situation in terms of information fragmentation, but it is what it is. I'm not super keen on trying to tie all of these together (that was kind of a mess on slack/telegram), but if enough people whine I'll think about it.
