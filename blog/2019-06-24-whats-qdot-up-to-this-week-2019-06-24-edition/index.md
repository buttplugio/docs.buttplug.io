title: Whats Qdot Up To This Week 2019 06 24 Edition

So remember when I was all "Wow I can still code during new job! I can't believe I haven't hit a wall yet!"

Guess who hit the wall.

<!--truncate-->

### Software (Intiface/Buttplug/Etc)
Yeah there's almost nothing to say here. I've done a tiny bit of cleanup and maintenance but nothing much to speak of. Schedule changes finally caught up with me and it's been hard for me to get in the coding groove for the past couple of weeks. This means a lot of stuff like the new Intiface Tutorial, new web app widgets, etc... are sitting half done currently.

That said...

### Buttpluggin' With qDot Videos
When God closes a buttplug shaped door, they open a buttplug shaped window.

For some reason I decided it was time to make videos, which is why the Youou AV Vibrator video happened last week, and now I'm in the middle of production on the first of what is going to be a very long series on hardware video sync. I consider this project documentation, so it's nice to feel like I'm still getting stuff done, even if it's not code.

### New Pornhub Account
Since Youtube has also been rather scattershot in their regulation of content lately, I'm trying to set up some insurance just in case my YT account gets axed. While it's not a place I'm super fond of due to lots of reasons, I've caved on my ethics and created a Pornhub account, and am uploading Buttpluggin' With qDot videos there. Please subscribe/friend if you've got an account!

### Upcoming Tier Reward Changes
Also of note, next month I'll be announcing some tier reward changes, including at the rather popular $1/$3 levels. Don't worry, I'm not going to yank rewards that anyone currently enjoys, but I've needed to redo stuff for a while (a lot of the rewards go unclaimed/unused) and it's finally time to refine things a bit. I'll be announcing this sometime after the July rollover, so it won't take effect until August.

### Discord
I've been getting reports that the Patreon discord bot is acting up, so if you join the discord and don't get a Patron role, please poke me. If you haven't joined the discord yet, well, you should join!

That's it for now. Hopefully the Video Sync Intro will be done in the next few days, and as patrons, you'll be the first to get a peek at it!

Until next update, Keep Buttpluggin'!
