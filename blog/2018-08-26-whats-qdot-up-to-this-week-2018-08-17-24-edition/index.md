---Well at least I have a good excuse for the first 2 week gap I've had in these updates, heh.As you are probably aware because I haven't (been allowed to) shut up about it for the past 2 weeks, the 268 teledildonics patent is now expired. So far this has meant LOTS of talking to press. A few examples:

I really doubt any of you see this will find much of above educational, since you're paying me to write at you about it once a week at a minimum. The attention has still been quite good for the project though, as it was even posted on everyone's most favorite/most hated orange website, Hacker News.

Anyways, that's mostly died down so now it's back to work. I've been on semi-vacation the past few days at the SF Pen Show (documented at [https://twitter.com/qDot/status/1032720657539260416](https://twitter.com/qDot/status/1032720657539260416) if you're really curious), but with that winding down today and the C# client code at a "done enough" state, I'm planning to get back to writing the developer guide and example code work. There's been more and more interest about how to use the API lately, but outside of a few examples I made for the JS library, there's not really a good guide on how to use any of this outside of showing up on the discord and asking me. Getting that fixed up will hopefully let people work on their own.

Other than that, got a few more toys to reverse and add, and hopefully can start looking at restarting the localization project soon so we can support more languages.

Since the teledildonics patent is expired, I can also say: Yes, I plan on working on a generalized teledildonics server. The goal is to provide a server that is containerizable so people can just bring it up on VM instances as needed quickly, though I'm also considering other hosting options. While the current setup is pretty good for local connections, I've had lots of requests for things like Second Life, Telegram, Discord, etc support and this is the missing piece there.

That's enough of a ToDo list to fill up the next few months so I'm gonna shut up and get back to work now. :)
