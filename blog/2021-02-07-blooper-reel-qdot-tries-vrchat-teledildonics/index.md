Well I promised bloopers in the tiers at one point, but the past couple of years are mostly me yelling at code so not many interesting ones have happened.

I've been trying VRChat + VibeGoesBrrr this weekend, which has taken some learning to try and get the avatar workflow correct. Above is a video of me trying to intersect a grabbable object in VRC with a collider area to try and trigger a toy and it's... not working well.
