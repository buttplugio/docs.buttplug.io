That was quick.

New version attached to this message.

A patron already found a bug where the new Intiface Desktop icon would overwrite the old one on the start menu. I just updated to 0.0.2 which now calls the application "Intiface Desktop Rust" to counteract this.

Also hearing reports that the packed engine may not execute correctly, looking into that now.

Windows is such a fragile thing. :|
