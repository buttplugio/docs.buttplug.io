Too much stuff!

### Buttplug/Intiface Central
Finally got a new version of buttplug-rs and Intiface Central released! This implements the beginnings of our new v4 message spec, though it's only visible internally in the library right now. I've shipped it as part of the current Intiface Central so we can get people testing it though.

Which is why I had to quickly release an Intiface Central v2.6.2, because we found a huge bug in some of the new message translation code right after release. Oops.

Anyways, now that Central/Buttplug are basically stable, work now turns to adding new messages to v4 and trying to get those stabilized via testing with some of our trusted developers. More on that as it happens!

### Twitch
In the mean time, I've also started a twitch channel!

I've been wanting to make more video content for a while, but just doing videos without feedback is kinda boring, so I'm seeing how well streaming then editing for youtube works. So far... well, I've got a lot to learn, heh.

As mentioned, I will be trying to post when I stream, I just gotta come up with a schedule first, and that may take a bit.

Please let me know if you've got topics you'd like to see on stream! I'll probably let people here vote on topics once I get a few streams under my belt. Current plans include:

- Building OSR-2/SR-6 on stream

- Tutorial on building basic mods for Unity games

- GHR overview and explanation

- Tutorial on the websocket device system

- Building out device visualizers on stream since I can't really show real hardware

### Everything Else

- I built a Peglin mod! You can check it out here: [https://thunderstore.io/c/peglin/p/nonpolynomial/Pegginglin/](https://thunderstore.io/c/peglin/p/nonpolynomial/Pegginglin/)

- Renpona made RUMP! It's a super neat vtuber av event system based on buttplugio! [https://renpona.itch.io/rumbling-universal-mayhem-plugin](https://renpona.itch.io/rumbling-universal-mayhem-plugin)

That's it for now. Until next time, Keep Buttpluggin'!
