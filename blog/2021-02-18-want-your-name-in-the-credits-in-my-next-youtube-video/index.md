Hello, special people in my >= $10 tiers!

I'm going to be adding a new perk to all of these tiers, the ability to get your name at the end of my youtube videos for as long as you're a patron at these levels!

<!--truncate-->

However, due to the nature of my videos and some people possibly wanting to stay anonymous or just not be included, this perk is **OPT-IN.**

If you'd like your name (doesn't have to be you real name, or even your donor name, just not a URL or something), **please send me a message either here on Patreon, or on discord or twitter if you're in touch with me there, and let me know what you'd like it to be.**

My next video will probably be out in the next few days, so get back to me **soon **if you'd like to be included!
