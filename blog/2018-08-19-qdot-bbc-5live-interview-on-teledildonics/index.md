title: "Qdot Bbc 5live Interview On Teledildonics"
date: 2018-08-19
---I did a quick interview with BBC 5Live. At 3:45am UK time, heh. Luckily it was 7:45pm for me. Above link is my recording of it, please don't redistribute. Actual BBC archive is at [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bfxpfy,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bfxpfy,) I'm 2:43:00 in.  
  
Don't expect to learn much here but you can at least listen to me be awkward!

Weekly update coming tomorrow because Holy fuck it has been a WEEK and I just want to sit here and play Yakuza 0 and not talk about teledildonics for a bit.
