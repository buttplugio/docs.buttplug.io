title: Still Buttpluggin

The code binge to get C#/Win10 buttplug out the door continues, and it's going really well! Support for the Fleshlight Launch, Vibrating Lovense Toys, and XInput/XBox compatible gamepads is in and working, and I'm hoping to start implementing some applications on top of this functionality soon, ahead of a v0.0.1 release.I'm also starting to plan for the post C# world, mostly looking forward to getting back to the comfyness of Rust. I've done a bit of repo shuffling, so now the main buttplug repo ([http://github.com/metafetish/buttplug)](http://github.com/metafetish/buttplug)) is now just documentation, json schemas, etc. I've moved the rust implementation to [http://github.com/metafetish/buttplug-rs.](http://github.com/metafetish/buttplug-rs.) The JSON schema for the messages I have implemented in C# so far is done, and this should be a HUGE help on implementing clients and servers in other languages.

Unfortunately, I do realize I'm running way behind on the tier rewards. Like, so far behind they haven't even happened yet. I'm also assuming most donors are going to be interested in Buttplug once it's released too though, so I'm just counting on that. If you REALLY want your tier reward, feel free to poke me and we can figure something out. :)
