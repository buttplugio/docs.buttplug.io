Recovering.

# SLSA
Most of my life for the past week was attending the Society for Literature, Science, and the Arts (SLSA) conference in Irvine, CA. Conference went quite well, I did a talk on the Game Haptics Router as a tool for creating new haptic spaces for communication, analyzing the strategy via proxemics. Reception was surprisingly good. I should have a version of the talk filmed and up on Youtube by the end of the week.

# Buttplug
Rust 1.39 is out, which means async/await is now stable. This should accelerate library updates, which means it'll hopefully be easier to build stuff soon. No real code work otherwise, didn't have time with conference and all.

And that's pretty much it for the past week. Once I'm rested up, hoping to get back to work on buttplug-rs, as well as merging a lot of new device support code in C#, including the Lelo F1s.

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
