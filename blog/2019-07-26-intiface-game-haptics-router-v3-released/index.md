In yet another pivot to a random product (for reasons that will be shown in the next post), I've just upgraded the Game Haptics Router to v3. This puts it back at feature parity with the Game Vibration Router, meaning:

<!--truncate-->

- Baseline vibration works again

- Vibration Multiplier works again

- Autoupdate annoyer works again

That's pretty much it for now. I've scoped some work for getting the Fleshlight Launch and other toys working with this too, but that's still fairly far down the priority chain.
