[https://github.com/FredTungsten/ScriptPlayer/releases](https://github.com/FredTungsten/ScriptPlayer/releases)ScriptPlayer 1.0.3 was released this morning, now with Whirligig support! This means you can now use any buttplug compatible toy with a real VR Movie Player, versus our hacked together player in Syncydink that I still need to fix up.

I haven't checked with the Whirligig dev yet, but in testing we've had to run with the Beta version of Whirligig on Steam, so you may need to set the beta channel. There's info on how to use ScriptPlayer and Whirligig together at

And for all of you who are about to ask "But when can we use it with Win 7?": I helped out on some of the development to make sure ScriptPlayer at least runs in Win7.

I'm hoping to have the alpha version of the Win7 BLE server available in the next day or two, for patreon members only. :)
