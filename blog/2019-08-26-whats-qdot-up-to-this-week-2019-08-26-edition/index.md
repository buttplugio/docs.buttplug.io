PENS.

SO MANY PENS.

<!--truncate-->

(I was at the San Francisco Pen Show last weekend. Many pens were... written with.)

### Intiface
In between pen fondling, I managed to get a good portion of the new Intiface Tutorial done. The pure-web version is done, now it's mostly down to finishing up Intiface Desktop setup/install/check steps. Hoping to have this out in the next week or two.

The major problem now is figuring out where it goes. When I wrote the original Buttplug tutorial, we had a crappy, hard-to-extend GUI. Intiface Desktop is basically a full web browser (thanks, electron), so I've got a lot more room to work. Trying to decide if I want to integrate it into Intiface AND have it on the web or what. I have given myself way too many options here.

After this, it's back to finishing buttplug-py, then hopefully getting to implementing new messages and maybe rolling all libraries to v1 before the end of the year.

### FFXIV Buttplugs
For those of you watching twitter, the Final Fantasy XIV ACT plugins made the rounds again after a redditor updated ButtplACT ([https://github.com/crnlskn/ButtplACT/](https://github.com/crnlskn/ButtplACT/)) and posted about it there. It got some traction this time, making it to a couple of gaming blogs. Pretty awesome!

Though weirdly enough, there's now like, 3-4 FFXIV ACT plugins using Buttplug. It's possibly the most implementations of something using Buttplug at the moment. Unexpected. Like, we only have 2 movie players right now (3 if you could the Kodi work done in 2017).

Anyways, I'm gonna try to make a video about this soon. I just gotta figure out how to play FFXIV first. If anyone is interested and plays, lemme know.

### Other Buttplug Stuff
The FFXIV thing sent me on a vanity search of github, and I managed to find some other projects using Buttplug, including:

 - [https://github.com/hottail/HotTail](https://github.com/hottail/HotTail) - One of the other ACT plugins I mentioned
 - [https://github.com/BytewaveMLP/DGButtPlugin](https://github.com/BytewaveMLP/DGButtPlugin) - A Duck Game Buttplug Mod?!
 - [https://github.com/Inari-Whitebear/KSPButtplug](https://github.com/Inari-Whitebear/KSPButtplug) - A Kerbal Space Program mod I had forgotten about

It's really neat finding projects that use buttplug that I didn't even know about! Gonna work toward featuring more of these on Metafetish.

### Businessy Stuff
While I'm not sure anyone cares, work on the Nonpolynomial website continues apace. Once this is done, I'll be doing more blogging about the technical side of Buttplug/Intiface, while keeping content related posts (like the mod announcements above) to Metafetish.

That's it for now. Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
