[https://metafetish.club/t/buttplug-standard-document-review-thread/31](https://metafetish.club/t/buttplug-standard-document-review-thread/31)I just finished writing the first draft of the Buttplug Protocol Spec. This is the message board thread for the refinement conversation. 

If you're the kind of person that enjoys systems planning work, please take a look at it and lemme know on the message board thread if you have any suggestions, if anything is missing, etc...

If you don't know whether you enjoy systems planning work but always wondered what sort of exciting documents engineers get to write, print this out and read it before bed. It should put you right out. :)
