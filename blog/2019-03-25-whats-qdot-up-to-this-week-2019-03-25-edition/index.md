Survived Pittsburgh. Now back at home and trying to make body adjust back to my normal timezone.

### Stickers!
Yes! Actual physical tier rewards! I'll be adjusting it this week, but from now on, anyone who donates $3/month or more will get 2 stickers mailed to them after their first successful payment (assuming they want them)!

Images of the stickers are attached at [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2Y5TpnU8AUJ01R.jpg:large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2Y5TpnU8AUJ01R.jpg:large) because patreon is being weird.

Of course, I wouldn't want to forget the rest of you who've already been donating forever with little to show for it other than getting to read my personal updates (well ok and getting to use the software it funds). I'll be sending notices to everyone who's donated >= $3 over their patronage to me. Yes, this includes $1/month people who've been donating for a while! Consider it a perk of getting on the qDot train early.

This first batch of stickers was a last minute deal, and I do plan on having more printed soon with different designs. But I'm still pretty happy with how these came out.

### What Happened In Pittsburgh
Almost all of my time in Pittsburgh was spent writing my presentation slides and workshop materials, as well as talking to a ton of people. There will be a recording of the talk up sometime in the future, though it may take a couple of months due to lack of resources on CMU's end. I'm hoping to do the talk more often though, so it may get either recorded again or else I may just end up doing it in other places. Or both.

Workshop was the first time I've presented Buttplug in public, and it went decently, all things considered. Only had about 30 minutes about code, most of the workshop was focused on familiarizing attendees with different hardware types and interfaces. Everyone seemed to enjoy it though.

There's some photos from the talk and workshop up at [https://www.flickr.com/photos/creativeinquiry/albums/72157690345973723.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/creativeinquiry/albums/72157690345973723.)

If you'd like to have me speak or host a workshop where you are, please let me know! Now that I have some material written this is actually an option.

### Intiface
I tried releasing Intiface before I left and that turned into a major clusterfuck. No code work happened last week, so I'm going to try to get this back on track over the next week or two. The code itself *works, *the problem is that when it's built on CI and uploaded to github, it's not cryptographically signed, and Mac/Windows require that. I've got solutions for both Mac and Windows, they're just different and take some time to set up, which I didn't have before I left. I'll be posting updates about this as it happens, as I'd really like to get everyone moved off the Windows Buttplug Server ASAP.

### Other Stuff
Since Intiface is at least close to shipping, I'm hoping I can start dividing work between getting the GUI updated, starting to update Playground/Syncydink, and maybe starting to implement new features like input messages in Buttplug. Lots of exciting stuff ahead! Just gotta shake this jet lag first.

Keep Buttpluggin'!
