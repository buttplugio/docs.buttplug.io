omfg buttplug spec v4 might be out before the end of the year

# Buttplug
Currently working through implementing new versions of the Buttplug client! So far I've gotten Rust and Typescript done, next up is C#, then Python. After that, I'll be updating all of the examples in the documentation, at which point we'll be pretty close to done.

<!--truncate-->

We've still got a lot of random device bugs floating around in the latest version, but we may just release with some of those as they're on devices almost no one actually has.

For those that've picked up the Lovense Spinel, we do have support for it in the library now, and I'll be doing another beta release of Central soon to pick that up.

# Intiface Central
Mostly doing bugfixing in Central right now. Got limit UI for linear devices working again, otherwise holding off on adding anything new because I'm mostly interested in just getting v3 out with the new spec under it, *then* I'll get to work on Central updates.

# Buttplug Website
I haven't updated the [buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io) website since... 2018? 2019? Somewhere around there. It's super stale now. Planning to just fold the front page into our documentation site, since that's kind of the important part anyways. You can see the beginnings of that at

[https://beta.docs.buttplug.io](https://beta.docs.buttplug.io)

I'll also be bringing up a blog over there to do longer form posting about the library.

# Everything Else

- [We got another balatro mod!](https://github.com/Fraggenard/Buttlatro)

- [And a war thunder mod!](https://github.com/TheDR-lul/Tailgunner/)

Anyways, that's it for now. Starting to get a bit more time to work on things so I'm pretty hopeful I can get v4 out in 2025, then spend 2026 actually creating new stuff!

Until next time, keep Buttpluggin'!
