Ostensibly, yes.

The holiday break was surprisingly productive. I got a good bit of the "how to write a buttplug application" section of the Developer Guide written, did a few livestreams, posted an old presentation I did on youtube, and started cleaning up the MK312 repo to make it more accessible for people who want to build the board.

Not much happened in the way of code, mostly because I'm apparently still a little more burnt out than I thought after the huge C# push through the end of last year. I did start playing with a new version of what will become the Buttplug Server though. Also spec'd out a new idea around using phones as device servers, similar to something like FeelConnect for those of you that are familiar with it, but for local use instead of having to ping through a server.

So what's on for 2019?

- For those that haven't heard, I'm doing a Buttplug/sex tech related art residency at Carnegie Mellon Univ in March. This will include a lecture and workshop. The first quarter of the year will be dedicated to getting my shit together for that, which means documenting what we've currently got running and figuring out how to make it presentable to students. More info on this at [http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/events/spring-2019-steiner-lectures-in-creative-inquiry](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/events/spring-2019-steiner-lectures-in-creative-inquiry)

- Writing stuff other than client/server code. I still very much want to get back to making Buttplug apps myself. Our native support story still blows on anything not Windows (i.e. mac/linux don't have an easy device server to use outside of the browser), which is definitely a problem, but I can't keep throwing all of my time at that or I'm gonna go nuts.

- Merchandise! Finally! Damnit! (I've been trying to get around to stickers/shirts for many many years. I will make it happen this year and hopefully they will be donation tier gifts!)

- Finally starting on the networking/teledildonics side of this project. This encompasses a lot more than "just control someone else's toy". I'll be writing about it more soon.

- Ramping up more video/streaming presence. Streaming is kinda fun, it turns out.

- Trying to restore some sort of blog activity. It's been way too quiet for too long over there. Not sure what this is going to look like yet though.

That's a rough list, at least. Who knows where this year will end up taking me. I've stopped trying to predict, and instead just put out some vague hopes and we'll see what gets done.

Hope everyone is having a good 2019 so far! Keep Buttpluggin'!
