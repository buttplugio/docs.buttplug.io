Just realized I've missed Monday updates for a couple of weeks. I'm currently in some crunch time on a couple of projects, meaning the rest of my schedule has either shifted or just stopped being a thing. Hoping that'll be over this week and I can get back to regular updates next week.

There's some movement on Buttplug and related projects happening, so lots to talk about next Monday!
