I've just updated the Syncydink tutorial, because thanks to some nudging from a new patreon on here, I just finished some fixes and we now work on Android Chrome with VR and no extra software/apps required![https://metafetish.club/t/tutorial-syncydink-v20170821/82](https://metafetish.club/t/tutorial-syncydink-v20170821/82)

Basic steps:

<!--truncate-->

- Put movie files and haptics files on your phone somehow. I also recommend having a file explorer app like AndExplorer (free version is fine) handy so you can actually select the files in the syncydink interface

- Go to [https://buttplug.world/syncydink](https://buttplug.world/syncydink)

- Open your movie/haptics files in the player

- In the Buttplug tab, hit "Connect Local", then scan for and choose your devices

- Put the phone in VR mode, put it on your head, have fun!

One of the major things missing right now is any way to actually control a video while it's in VR. So, uh, beware that just because you're finished doesn't mean your phone or hardware might think you are. We're trying to figure out a good solution for this, but I currently don't have an android phone capable of VR (I'm working on a Nexus 7 which at least basically does the job) so it may be a bit before we get this worked out.

Let me know if you have any issues or feature requests. I'm gonna try to get parity between Windows and JS for bluetooth toys next, as well as starting on more doucmentation for all of this stuff.
