title: Buttplug Development Update

Funny how a month can fly by without noticing. I just made a quick update on metafetish about the current state of the buttplug repos, after realizing I didn't post anything at all during June. [https://www.metafetish.com/2017/07/05/metafetish-dev-log--week-of-20170703/](https://www.metafetish.com/2017/07/05/metafetish-dev-log--week-of-20170703/)

Now for the more in-depth version:

<!--truncate-->

I was out most of last week with a dayjob travel. Was hoping to get a lot of documentation done but ended up too tired. :/

Work is continuing on Buttplug, and I think we're close to release #1, but we're definitely hitting the 80/20 rule hard now. Did some bug/feature triage to try to get us to a minimal release. The major worry now is that we'll release software that no one has any idea how to use, but since we're also not sure of our target demographics yet, we may just have to release and let the reaction guide us from there.

Our movie player, syncydink, can now play movies and load haptics files. I'm working on getting that hooked up devices communication, and this may give us what we need to at least have something usable with our first release, though the UI may be rather spartan as I'm still figuring out this whole frontend development thing.

Also looking at building some simple control components just so people can make sure things are up and running ok before trying something like movie sync. This would possibly include the "random" controls that have been asked for constantly for toys like the Launch.

That's where things are at the moment. Back to work. Thanks for your continued support, and feel free to poke me if you want more updates. I've been lagging on them.
