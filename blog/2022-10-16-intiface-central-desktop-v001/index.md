Here we go.

<!--truncate-->

The first version of Intiface Central Desktop is live. Expect very basic functionality mirroring Intiface Desktop, but now using Buttplug v6, and running under flutter. Note that the devices panel is barely existent at the moment, so you won't be able to set up serial devices, test device control, etc... That's coming once I get the basics nailed down.

Builds for Windows 10+ x64 and macOS ARM are up. macOS x64 should be up later today. Linux will hopefully follow later this week. I'll also be getting everything building on CI so this'll be updated at some point.

In a departure from my normal modus operandi, right now the application is not open source. This is really fucking annoying, but as the codebase is shared between desktop and mobile, I have to wait until mobile ships on a store before I can open source things. Otherwise I'll have the system released to stores out from under me (this has happened to me in the past). So for alpha/beta phases, we're closed source. Plan is definitely to open source everything though.

For Android/iOS, I'm still figuring out how to distribute things. If you *really* want to be in on Android/iOS betas, please send me a private message and we'll figure something out. For Android, I'll try to make sideloadable APKs available. For iOS, this will require developer team setup so I'll need your Apple Account info, so be aware of that.

Will actually make an update post this week. Maybe.
