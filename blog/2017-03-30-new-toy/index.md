That's actually not mine (forwarding it to Internet of Dongs) but hey I can grab protocols before I reship. Vibratissimo Sette. Germany "underwear" toy. Has a temperature sensor as well as vibration, but there are no buttons on the device. It actually just stays on, constantly broadcasting until it dies. Only way to control it is an app that also has weird micro transaction purchases.
