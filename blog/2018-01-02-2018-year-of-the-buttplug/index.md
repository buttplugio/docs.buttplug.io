I mean, 2017 was too, but nothing saying that we can't have multiple years with that as the theme.Working on lots of documentation right now, as well as finishing up the Buttplug Twine interactive fiction engine integration so I can build our new interactive tutorial in that.

Also finished up scripts for 2 new videos, and got myself a fancy new microphone setup, so hopefully gonna have new video content posted this month!

Hope everyone had a good holiday season, and thanks again for your donations.
