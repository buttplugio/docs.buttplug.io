title: "Qa For Real This Time"

---Hello $3+ patrons! So way back when I started this Patreon, I said I was gonna do Q&A videos, answering questions for people that paid $3 or more a month. So far I have done zero of those. But that ends now! Maybe.I'm hoping to spend more time writing/filming than coding this month, and part of that is restarting the Q&A thing. If you've got questions you'd like answered, lemme know! I've got like 3 questions backed up from my first try at this, so definitely need to add more to that list.
