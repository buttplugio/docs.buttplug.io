Maybe I'll win the powerball so I can work on this fulltime...

# Buttplug
So much for doing a release candidate of the new version of Buttplug in August! Life got in the way and I wasn't really able to touch the project for the better part of the month.

<!--truncate-->

That said, got some time in this weekend to finish up the very boring but very needed Configuration Separation project. Basically, how we stored config was too intertwined with how we work with data in the system, and it ended up being a bit of a pulling apart a grilled cheese sandwich situation. Good news is that the feature is now complete, and I'm mostly working on getting bugs and tests fixed up.

After this, I'm hoping to sweep through and update documentation/APIs once again for the changes that brings in, then actually get to that release candidate. There's still a chance we'll ship the new REST API as part of the RC too!

# Intiface Central
Alongside the Buttplug updates, we'll be doing one last release of Intiface Central v2, in order to accommodate some device updates (including the Kiiroo Keon WiFi, for those of you that've been asking about it). I'm hoping to also get a "use beta version" option in this build so we can have people auto-update to RC's of Intiface Central when those are ready.

# Everything Else

- We're still seeing a steady stream of new game mods in with the current hardware, check out [https://awesome.buttplug.io](https://awesome.buttplug.io) to see what's new!

- Alongside all of this, a whole bunch of new VR Hardware just landed here, so I may be doing a stream or video on all of that soon. Not particularly buttplug related but there's some overlap in interests. :)

Hopefully a more productive month this upcoming month.

Until next time, Keep Buttpluggin'!
