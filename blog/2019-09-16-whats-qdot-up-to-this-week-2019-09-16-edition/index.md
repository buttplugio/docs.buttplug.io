More than usual, less than I want.

# Buttplug
Managed to get buttplug-py 0.1.0 out the door. With that and the tutorial being done, I'm hoping to get back to low level protocol development. This will including adding new features to the base system, like:

<!--truncate-->

- Battery Level Reporting
 - RSSI (radio strength) Reporting
 - Raw Data Commands (useful for developers, for debugging and bringing up new devices)
 - Pattern Commands (for playback of built in patterns on hardware)
 - Step Attributes (so we can say things like "This toy supports 20 steps of vibration")

Overall, this should make developing and interacting with applications that use buttplug a nicer experience for everyone. I hope.

For hardware, here's what we've got coming up:

 - Vibease Support (wow this protocol was a mess)
 - Kiiroo Titan 2.1 (Someday)
 - Nintendo Joycon
 - The Handy (more about this later in this update)
 - Motorbunny

# Intiface
Not a lot happening here at the moment, though I'm considering adding a file hosting mechanism to Intiface Desktop, so that it's easier to access movies/haptic files on desktop from phones or standalone VR Headsets. This would make Syncydink much more useful. Might chuck that together as a weekend project or something.

# Games
I'm in talks with a few more game developers, hopefully looking at more game integration soon! Will actually announce which games these are once things are solidified. 

# Hardware
I don't usually advertise hardware, but The Handy is back on sale after being off the market for 5 months, and at a new $149 price point.

It's an interesting device. I've got some fairly serious design grumps about it (it was built to be used lying down, and it shows), but it's well built and capable of a lot.

Also, I mentioned this in the last email, but if you're interested in the hardware we support as well as what's out there in general, blackspherefollower has been continuing to update IoSTIndex and it's looking great.

That's it for this week. Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
