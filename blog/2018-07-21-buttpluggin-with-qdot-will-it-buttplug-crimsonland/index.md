Yay, a Buttpluggin' with qDot video made in an evening instead of multiple weeks! A review of how well 10tons Ltd's Crimsonland (which I randomly picked up on steam for like $2 but ended up enjoying quite a bit as an actual game because I just love twin stick shooters) works as a sex toy controller.
