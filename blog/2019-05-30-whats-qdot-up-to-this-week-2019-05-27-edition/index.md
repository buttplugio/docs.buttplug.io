Well, I'm definitely not jobless anymore.

More just energyless now.

<!--truncate-->

But before we get to that, let's go over what happened while I was funemployed last week.

### Intiface Game Haptics Router
I finished up the redo of the Game Vibration Router, now called the Game Haptics Router. The currently posted version works with both VR and XInput again. It still needs some cleaning up, and I still want to get Linear movement support (for things like the Fleshlight Launch) in, but all in all it had a pretty successful release, and I was just happy to play with some applications using Buttplug again versus just writing the library.

### Buttplug
Buttplug itself got a couple of updates, mostly related to Hardware support. After many pokings and demands from users, I finally got Kiiroo Onyx 2.1 support into the library. It's not perfect, but Kiiroo makes it REALLY hard to interact with their toys, and it's a good enough stop gap for now.

### Intiface Desktop
Weirdly enough, I didn't really touch Intiface Desktop at all during the past week or so. It just kinda continues to chug along, doing what it's supposed to. The Buttplug updates were releases as new engines that it just downloads and updates for users automatically, which is pretty awesome.

The new goal is to finally deprecate the old Buttplug Server 0.2.3 completely and move everyone to Intiface Desktop. Major blocker on this is rewriting the Buttplug Tutorial into an Intiface Tutorial, and bringing up the Intiface domain as a landing page for the new software (so users no longer go to buttplug.io and it can be a developer focused site). This will happen... someday.

### The Now And The Future
So, now we get to the big question: WTF is the future gonna look like now that I've got a new dayjob?

Honestly, I dunno. I mean, I'm not dropping Buttplug or any of my other projects (I even worked this out with my new job as part of my discussions with them). But I'm also not sure how long on-boarding and schedule readjustment is going to take. I've been working from home for the past 6+ years, so this whole going to an office again thing is new, and I'm now involved in a lot more hardware work, which means not as much time sitting in front of machines. I'm sure things will even out at some point, but things may slow down a bit for the next few weeks while I figure all of this out.

What I'm hoping for and trying to plan on is a realignment of priorities for Buttplug and Intiface. I kinda had a *lot* of time to work on shit over the past couple of years, which meant I could kinda meander around and maybe take too long in order to get things just right. With a reduced amount of development time/energy, I'm going to be forced to focus on the important things and getting releases done as I can. So who knows, this may work out better in the end.

But good god I just need to sleep for like 14 hours right now.

Anyways, thanks for your continued support, and until next time, Keep Buttpluggin'!
