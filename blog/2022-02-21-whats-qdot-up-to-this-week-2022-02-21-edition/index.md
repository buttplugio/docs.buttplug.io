Same as it ever was...

# Buttplug
This will probably be the shortest weekly newsletter ever because, well, I'm still working on the same damn thing. Redesigning how we deal with device configurations so that users can build their own settings is now in Week 4 of development.

<!--truncate-->

The slow pace is mostly due to me having 1, maybe 2 days a week to work on things, mostly due to Life Getting In The Way. Though also because designing this has been difficult and required multiple iterations.

I *think* I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel now, and will have things done soon.

# Other Stuff

 - Part of Life Getting In The Way was VRChat releasing the beta of OSC on Av, which is something I've been waiting for since last April. As always,[ I did some dumb shit with it](https://twitter.com/qDot/status/1494724108830994436/).

Anyways, that's it for now. Back to the slog.

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
