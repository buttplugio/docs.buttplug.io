Being a day late, but hey, at least there's

### Stickers
Stickers are on their way to quite a few people now! I've got about 50% of the backed up tier rewards sent, and after picking up more envelopes and stamps yesterday the rest should go out this week. Look for mail!

### Buttplug
FFI work has begun!

I figured I'd try to roll a proof of concept of the API bridging layer, and it turns out that it's not too bad? Memory/lifetime management are going to be a little weird but such is life in FFI work. I've got a C# library that can at least bring up a rust buttplug client and start scanning, so now I just need to get device access together and we'll be rolling. Love it when things come together faster than planned.

However, due to my dayjob being SUPER busy, that's also it for this week. I didn't get much time to work on Buttplug this week and I expect things to be a little wild thru the end of the month, but I'll def keep the updates coming and can hopefully find more time to get things together. :)

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
