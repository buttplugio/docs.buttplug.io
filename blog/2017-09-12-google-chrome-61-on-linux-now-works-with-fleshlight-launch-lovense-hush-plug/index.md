I just updated to Chrome 61 on my Debian box, and whatever bug was holding up bluetooth usage on Chrome on Linux is fixed! The Fleshlight Launch now works fine with syncydink in local connect mode! Also tested the Lovense Hush Plug, it works too. I think this puts Linux Chrome in feature parity with macOS and Android for buttplug-js
