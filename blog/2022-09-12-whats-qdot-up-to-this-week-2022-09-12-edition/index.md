BLoCs!

### Intiface Central
The past 2 weeks have been almost purely Intiface Central UX work. This has required me to learn how state management works in flutter, which is Very Much Its Own Thing And Does It In Its Own Special Way. This was a good 4-5 days of reading and trying things until it finally clicked.

After that, everything came together surprisingly quick. I now have a basic version of Intiface Central running on Desktop, and I'm now trying to finish the work required to port that on to mobile. This mostly involves taking the Intiface CLI and turning it into both a CLI (for desktop) *and* a library (for mobile), which will now be known as Intiface Engine. Made good progress on this over the weekend, and I'm hoping to have everything building on Win/Mac/Linux/Android/iOS by next weekend.

Soooooo, I feel like I can now say we'll see an alpha of Intiface Central in weeks instead of months! This is huge progress. :D

### Everything Else

 - Having unblocked Buttplug with the v6 release, some of the device developers are working there again. v6.0.1 with more device updates and some bug fixes should be out soon.

That's it for now. Once information for joining the mobile alpha is available, I'll let everyone here know, as anyone that's a patron should be able to try it out!

Until next week, keep buttpluggin'!
