In an effort to get over my procrastination about making more videos, I'm going to see if I can go the route of "streaming then cutting it down for video content for youtube then also clipping that into tiny bits for tiktok" because that is just how the game is apparently played these days.

Not to mention, people seem to have all these "questions" about "how anything works" in Buttplug so this'll provide a forum for questions to happen in real time while I'm showing stuff off.

Plan for the first few streams:

- First stream will probably just be me testing things out and showing off how I'm going to work with Buttplug without actually showing sex toys on stream. This will be a demo of our websocket device manager system which a lot of people have asked about anyways.

- After that, I plan on doing a stream where I add some functionality to the new Peglin mod ([https://thunderstore.io/c/peglin/p/nonpolynomial/Pegginglin/](https://thunderstore.io/c/peglin/p/nonpolynomial/Pegginglin/) ), as well as go over the basics of BepinEx

- After that, probably just more streams about modding, maybe some library explanations, etc.

For showing off anything actually involving toys, that'll still be over on Fansly, as the twitch rules for showing sex toys are VERY weird and abstract. You can only show toys in an "educational manner", meaning if I make any sort of joke that's not considered educational while showing a toy, I could be banned. However, getting viewers over on Twitch is far easier than getting people to sign up on Fansly, so I figure this is worth a shot.

I'm still getting things set up right now but I'll try to give at least 24 hours notice here before streams are announced!
