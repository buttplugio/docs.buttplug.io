Making up excuses because I haven't shipped any

### Stickers
BUT.

<!--truncate-->

There's a good reason. Stickermule is replacing my lost hologram stickers and they get here tomorrow so I can send people hologram stickers! So that's just getting bumped up to this week.

And if you don't understand my obsession with hologram stickers then obviously you were not a baseball card collector in the early 90s who had multiple Upper Deck hologram team logo sticker sets.

This really means something.

Back to the technical shit.

### Buttplug
So last week I was all like "Hey I released buttplug-rs v0.5!" and now I'm going to get to be all like "Hey I released 0.6!" 'cause I'll be releasing that after I get done typing this up.

It turns out that all of the Intiface work I wanted to do relies on being able to connect to remote clients/servers, and I'd kinda forgotten to implement some server stuff to allow that in Buttplug-rs when I released v0.5. So I spent the weekend getting that fixed up, as well as fixing some bugs in other parts of the system.

The good news is, I *think* Buttplug-rs is mostly feature complete "enough" now. That probably sounds a little weird since it's still missing like, Fleshlight Launch protocol controls (as well as the OSR2 compatibility that multiple people are asking me about weekly), so feature complete doesn't mean "done", more just "don't have any more large architecture pieces that need to happen currently".

### Intiface
Good news is, while building the new Buttplug-rs stuff this weekend I was testing against the new Intiface engine, so that's ready to go too. I'll be able to release that tonight, and then get to work on figuring out what the fuck to do about Intiface Desktop, which is still going to be a nightmare (I haven't touched the code since May 2019 :( ).

Anyways, that's it for this week. I feel like this is a good update, because instead of "I have [random list of features only I care about] to implement" I'm now close to saying "You can actually use some of this shit". :D

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
