What once was a weekly newsletter is quickly turning bi-annual heh.

# Intiface Central
Well the good news is, I finally got a new version of Intiface Central out! Not a ton to say about it because I've had almost no time to work on new features, but it does integrate a bunch of device updates that've happened over the past 5 months.

<!--truncate-->

We're also in discussions about creating a "simple" mode for Intiface. This was requested by a user who then actually provided wireframes, which is way more than we normally get! If you're interested in checking out the direction is this going, see [https://github.com/intiface/intiface-central/issues/185](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-central/issues/185)

# Buttplug
I've started working on the neverending project that is Buttplug v4 again. I think I've shaved the new protocol down as much as possible, which should make life much easier on both Buttplug app devs and client devs for new/different languages. At this point, the work is mostly down to fixing backward compatibility (so all of our apps on the current protocols stay work), and making sure everything still functions. It's slow going, but it's getting there.

# HTTP/REST Buttplug
While the above work is happening, I'm also finally looking at simplifying buttplug down to a REST API. We've had complaints for years that the current system is too complex for a lot of developers, so I'm hoping a simple web API will open things up even more. This will be integrated into Intiface Central, and I'll post OpenAPI specifications here as they become available.

# Everything Else

- I'm still absorbing the life changes of the past 6 months, hence the slow development and lack of news. I'm not really sure what my development schedule is going to end up looking like, but I feel like I'm slowly making progress.

- I spoke at NYU last month about the experience of developing Buttplug! I'll be doing a stream of the talk soon.

- We've had lots of new additions to game mods and apps, including an MCP layer, as well as mods for R.E.P.O., Garfield Kart, and others. Everything is updated on [https://awesome.buttplug.io](https://awesome.buttplug.io)

- We've gotten a lot of free members following here on patreon, so I'm opening this newsletter up to them in order to say Paid Subscriptions Are Appreciated! As the project is free I don't really get much income for it outside of Patreon and Affiliates, so every dollar is appreciated!

That's it for now. Until next time I decide to write one of these things, Keep Buttpluggin'!
