Burnt out, apparently.Not a lot to update on at the moment. I seem to have hit a burnout wall pretty hard a couple of weeks ago and am working my way out of that now. My brain can't seem to make code come out for anything other than my dayjob, so Buttplug dev is going slow. I'm mostly resting (and playing Red Dead Redemption 2) and doing little things here and there, but I don't foresee any major development happening until Christmas week, when I've got lots of time off.

In the time when I am productive, I'm doing some video work at the moment to try and get more content on the Youtube channel, and I would really like to have at least 1 or 2 tutorial chapters of the Buttplug Developer Guide up by the end of the year.

I'm also stocking up on circuit boards for the MK-312, Nogasm, Venus 2k controller, and other sex hardware projects. If you don't know what those are, well, I'm also trying to make youtube videos about them, so there will be more info on that soon (including a new Tier perk!).

That's it for now. Hope everyone is having a less burnt-out time than me. :D
