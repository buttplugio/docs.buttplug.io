Re-filming the Fleshlight launch teardown since I wasn't really happy with the first run thru. Looks like it'll end up being nearly an hour when I'm done, but it's a top to bottom analysis of the toy, the services it works with, marketing around it, etc. Hoping to have it out this week, just depends on how long editing takes.
