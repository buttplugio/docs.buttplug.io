Finally got through the store page part of the process, now just gotta get a build up and a trailer made. Aiming for Steam release early November.

This is mostly in the service of making Steam Deck installs easier. Otherwise it'll just be a shitpost, mostly because I've always wanted to add Achievements to my software. There may be paid DLC in the future, which will mostly be for incredibly, useless dumb features that will not affect core usability, as a funding strategy for the project. All core features will remain free.
