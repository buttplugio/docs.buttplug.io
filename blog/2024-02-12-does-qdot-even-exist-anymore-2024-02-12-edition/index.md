Sorta?

### Buttplug
Things have been pretty quiet on the Buttplug/Intiface front lately. The good news is, reconstruction of my workspace is done! The not so good news is, moving back in is taking forever and life in general has gotten in the way of me having development time, so everything is a bit stalled right now.

<!--truncate-->

Next big goal remains getting the new configuration system in then building on top of that for things like device simulators, user specified devices, etc, just need to get time to get the last bit of it over the line.

### Everything Else

 - [Intiface works on the Apple Vision Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLc3d2MD_0g&feature=youtu.be)! But please do not take this as a recommendation to actually buy the thing, no one has any clue what to do with it yet, me included.

Yup, that's pretty much it for now, but I figured I'd at least show some signs of life. Until next time, Keep Buttpluggin'!
