Around the time I started Buttplug, I met up with someone on the Milovana web tease forums, where a good chunk of the anime Cock Hero community hangs out. They were working on a C# based movie player with Launch support, mostly focused on the Cock Hero community.They ended up putting out their first beta release last week:

That post lists the github release page and scripts repo. I recommend reading the rest of the thread as there's some information on how to use it, as well as some interesting comments. The player is open source and on github, so if you feel like it you can build it in VS2017 and get the latest patches that way.

While this version of ScriptPlayer does list Buttplug support, ignore that, as the current beta doesn't work with our current builds (our patches to fix that are landed in ScriptPlayer, but they haven't built a new release yet).

We're of course still working on our own web-based movie player, but we're working with this developer to make sure Buttplug support stays up to date. This video player has also been a massive help in QA for Buttplug C# libraries. :D
