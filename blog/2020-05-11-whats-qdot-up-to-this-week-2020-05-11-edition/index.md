Dear sweet mother of god

### Media
So Buttplug had a big week in the media last week! We were on Hacker News and r/linux.

Between the two, the Buttplug website ended up with somewhere around 400x its normal traffic the first day, and 5 days later, I'm still at around 10x normal.

Both threads were *overwhelmingly* positive, which is not really what I expect from either venue. On HN I even got a shot out from the mods and a user about how well things went!

Super positive results overall, and lots of new people on the discord! Yay!

### Buttplug
On the software side, a super busy weekend of getting things running for people who'd really like to start using buttplug-rs. This meant new releases of:

 - buttplug-py, with lots of bugfixes
 - buttplug-rs, with the ability to reuse ButtplugServer (handy for our CLI)
 - intiface-cli-rs, which can now reuse servers (handy for dropped connections)

I've also been working on Serial Port and Lovense Dongle support in buttplug-rs, though those are going a bit slow because buttplug-rs is turning into a big messy pile of code. My plan is to take a small break from those implementations to get some cleanup and documentation efforts going, then return when I don't feel like I'm building a fireplace in the middle of a fire.

### Everything Else

 - Still wanna make a OSR2+ video or 5 soon
 - May make a Lovense Dongle video because I get SO MANY QUESTIONS
 - I'm gonna be on Australian Radio today, will post the podcast when it's up

I think that's it for now!

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
