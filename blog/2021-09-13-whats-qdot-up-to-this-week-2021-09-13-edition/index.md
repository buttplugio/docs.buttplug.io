Watching the bugs roll in...

# Buttplug/Intiface
First off, some pretty big news:

<!--truncate-->

**WeVibe Vector and other toys that have been flaky for years now work with Buttplug!**

Thanks to a contribution from one of our community members, there are now fixes in for WeVibe toys that make previous unreliable hardware work with our library! This is a huge step for hardware support.

We also updated our toy support for Lovense Quest, so that's working now too.

Last night, I released Intiface Desktop v26 and Intiface CLI v40, which integrates the new Buttplug v5 library. This adds a bunch of new features that it's going to take me a while to expose, but we're on track to having Device Simulation and easier new device additions for DIY/makers. More info on this as I get things documented and UI built out!

# Upcoming UI Overhauls
One of the next big projects is going to be the next move of Intiface Desktop to another UI basis. We started out with C#, which was windows only (and yes I realize MAUI is on the way and no I don't think it'll be a great solution for us quite yet), then moved to Electron, which is cross platform but extremely difficult to maintain, especially since I'm writing less and less Typescript these days. I'm now looking at porting some of our GUIs to Rust, in a way that will work on both desktop and the web. We'll see how this ends up going, but expect more updates on this soon.

As a patron, you'll also be first in line to try betas of these new releases!

# Youtube
I'm also trying to start cranking out more youtube videos, as I'm averaging about 5-6 per year on the Buttpluggin' with qDot channel right now, mostly because they're incredibly time consuming to make. To fix this, I'm now trying to make shorter videos as part of the Ask A Teledildonticist series, the intro to which I posted earlier today. If you've got questions you'd like answered, please message them to me!

That's it for this week. Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
