Videos and toy support!We had a couple of questions about toy support this week that we're now getting filled in. Turns out the Kiiroo Onyx 1 was never fully supported in our Kiiroo code, so one of our contributors took care of that. We also now support the WeVibe Classic, as requested by someone on the forums. Finally, I now have access to a Estim Systems 2B, meaning we can fill out a bit more of our estim support.

In Youtube land, I finally cranked out another Will It Buttplug video, covering Crimsonland, a twin stick shooter that also works as a surprisingly decent vibration pattern output. The big deal here is that I managed to get the video out in 2 hours start to finish, versus the usual 3-5 day filming/editing time of the hardware analysis videos. Hoping to get a better pace on video output now, and have a few more games lined up to test!

Finally, welcome to my 3 new patrons this week! Been great to get more support, and I look forward to providing you with quality buttplug related content.
