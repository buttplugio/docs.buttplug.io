Buttplug v2!

### Buttplug
After discovering some nice structures in tokio v1 that would allow me to massively clean up some of the nastier parts of Buttplug, I spent the last week doing just that.

<!--truncate-->

tl;dr Using the library in rust sucks way less now, using any other language on top of the FFI looks in no way different. >.>

This ended up being a ton of work that I'll hopefully now be writing some blog posts about, but everything from btleplug up through the FFI libraries and the CLIs got a upgrade.

Also, for anyone using Intiface Desktop, Lovense dongle support got quite a few bug fixes.

Also also, there's now support for the Lovense Ferri, and the Lovense Edge 2 works with all versions of Buttplug old and new.

Also also also, gonna try to start work on Satisfyer devices, which are *weirdly* cheap. [https://us.satisfyer.com/us/](https://us.satisfyer.com/us/)

### Intiface Desktop
I really, really, *really* need to get back to updating Intiface Desktop. I'm hoping buttplug is at a spot where it can stay in a holding pattern for the next month or so, outside of updates for the Handy and maybe the OSR 2.

I have some simplification of Intiface Desktop started, and I'll do an intermediate release once that work is finished so we can have nice things like crash reports and less people trying to use the old C# engine.

After that, I'm hoping to start adding new features like a device configuration tab, and maybe, just maybe, starting on remote features (aka teledildonics) over WebRTC.

### Intiface GHR
Haven't heard much from anyone after the GHR update last week, but I'm assuming it at least works. Still would like to get stroking devices in there soon too.

That's it for now. Not much of an update because I've been so heads down on v2, but hopefully I'll bounce back quick.

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
