Ok, short one for this week because it's been ~7 weeks since the last update, but there's good reason for that.

My partner was in the hospital for an extended amount of time and had major surgery, meaning I haven't really had a ton of time to write much here or elsewhere. Luckily we're back home now, but I'm still spinning back up on having a life that does not revolve around the hospital again.

I managed to get a bunch of the work I did on Intiface Central in March/April out as v2.4 a couple of weeks ago (though iOS just went out today). I'm now working on some new APIs for client device access that will hopefully make life easier on developers using the Buttplug library. Really looking forward to getting the first version of this out, though it'll need to be quickly followed up by documentation updates.

After that, the plan is to continue on Intiface Central UX improvements, starting with bugfixes from v2.4 updates as well as being able to add Websocket Devices through the UI (which are about to become *very* important for some fun reasons I'll talk about soon), and starting work on figuring out desktop/mobile linkage and discovery.

Hopefully will be getting back nearer weekly updates over the next couple of months, but there may be gaps for a while.
