APPS

### Intiface Central
Well, I am as shocked as anyone else, but Android and iOS apps are up, running, and seem fairly stable?!

<!--truncate-->

I spent the weekend hammering out platform specific issues mostly having to do with dumb buildchain mistakes, but I've got the app running on both platforms, with the ability to start/stop the server, connect/disconnect toys, change settings, and basically be functional as a minimal version of desktop!

I'm now just down finishing out a couple of the panels so the first version doesn't ship with anyone blank, then I'll be ready to start accepting testers. I figure for android I'll probably just distribute an APK, and iOS it'll require people use testflight and be on my dev account team so I'll send instructions for those interested once it's time to do that.

Can't wait to start getting this into people's hands!

(And that was everything that happened this week, but I mean, come *on*)

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
