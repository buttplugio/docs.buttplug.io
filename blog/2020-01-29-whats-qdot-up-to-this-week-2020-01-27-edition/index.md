Being late to the update and not having much to say because I'm sick. Respiratory infections suck.

### **Buttplug**
Work continues on getting buttplug-rs inline with C#. Getting lots of protocols ported and tested, looking good for a next release soon.

Annnd that's it.

Until next week (when I will hopefully have more news and less illness), Keep Buttpluggin'!
