Finally decided to stop waiting for all of the equipment I'd ordered to film, and just filmed yesterday. Did an unboxing-ish thing (since I unboxed it right when I got it it's not a true unboxing. I am horrible.) and teardown of the fleshlight launch. I'll be editing together the material over the next couple of days and posting soon to my new Youtube channel.Also, I'll be adding a new perk for all patrons: Blooper reel! It's less funny and more violently awkward, especially since I decided to try doing this episode without a script to see how well I could improv. 

The answer is: not well.
