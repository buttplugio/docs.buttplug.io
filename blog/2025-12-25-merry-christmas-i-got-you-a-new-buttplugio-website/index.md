title: Merry Christmas, I got you a new Buttplug.io website!
--- 

Because why spend the holiday with friends and family when you can spend it debugging docusaurus.

The new [https://buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io) website is live, and for the first time in years I don't dread updating it now. There's a blog, as well as the documentation for both the current version of the spec (v3) and the upcoming versions (v4, hopefully out by... next Wednesday. :| ).
