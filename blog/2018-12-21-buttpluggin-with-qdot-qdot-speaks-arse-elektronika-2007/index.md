One of the things I've been horrible about is archiving my past presentation work. Now that I've got a youtube channel, I'm aiming to both fix that and also get easy content together that doesn't require much new work on my end. With that in mind, here's a remaster of a sex tech overview presentation I did in 2007. This youtube version is censored in a few places because this is back when I thought it was edgy to throw porn in my slides, but I may have an uncensored version up elsewhere soon.
