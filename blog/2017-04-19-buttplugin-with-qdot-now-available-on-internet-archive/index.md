For those that don't want to watch via Youtube, Buttplugin' with qDot is now available for download on Internet Archive! [https://archive.org/details/buttplugin-with-qdot-episode-0001-fleshlight-launch-overview-and-teardown](https://archive.org/details/buttplugin-with-qdot-episode-0001-fleshlight-launch-overview-and-teardown)

I'll be building an RSS feed for these soon too, so they can be used in podcast/vidcast apps.
