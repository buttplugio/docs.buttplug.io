Mostly trying to figure out what I should be up to. :|

### Roadmap
That's right, right now the only thing I'm trying to work on is some sort of fucking roadmap. I've got too many projects in various forms of flight right now:

<!--truncate-->

- btleplug (needs some android fixes)

- buttplug (needs to move to spec v4)

- intiface engine/central (needs TONS of UI updates)

- media event router (i.e. the new GHR except way more abstract)

- Misc: Half done AHK bindings, half done Nightmare Kart mod, mostly done Gwent mod, etc...

- Trying to reboot my video properties 'cause I kinda miss it?

Things have now gotten to the point where I'm gonna have to sit down and plan out what order to do things in, possibly start looking at what I can maybe farm out, and what I can kick way down the road.

Due to a combination of Furality then other tempestuousness over the past month, very little has gotten done, so instead of just trying to embark on whatever I figure I'll try to plan. We'll see if that gets anywhere.

That said, if you've read this far along and have anything you'd specifically like to see, let me know! You do give me money, after all, so I'm inclined to listen.

But, yeah, that's pretty much it for right now. Until next time, keep buttpluggin'!
