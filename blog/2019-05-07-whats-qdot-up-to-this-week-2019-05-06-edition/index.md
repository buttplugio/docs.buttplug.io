Getting a new job!

And thus, fuck-all happened on the project this week, codewise, because engineering interviews are the fucking worst.

<!--truncate-->

Anyways, yes, I'm changing dayjobs, which is going to possibly cause a bit of upheaval and slowdown in project progress for the next month or two as I readjust to a new schedule and new ways to spend 8 hours a day after being at the same company for 7.5 years.

That said, I'm going back into the firmware/embedded world, with a focus on CV/ML, so that'll be super exciting! However, I'm also going back into the startup world, which is scary af, so we'll see how this turns out.

### Buttplug
Despite the insanity of the past couple of weeks, I did manage to get another version of buttplug-js out, with support for the iOS BLE app. We now at least have *some* foothold on every major desktop and mobile platform. 

### Other
That library upgrade is about all I've been able to manage at the moment. Main goal for now is still to get Intiface (the new Desktop Buttplug Server app) shippable to everyone.

In closing, check out this new project that uses Buttplug!
