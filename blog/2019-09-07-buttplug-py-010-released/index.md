Buttplug Python 0.1.0 is out, and is now something I don't feel quite so bad about pushing to public package repos. There's way more documentation, and it actually throws errors and what not now.

With the tutorial and python library out of the way, I'm now hopefully free to work on protocol level upgrades for the first time in, uh... wow, 18+ months?
