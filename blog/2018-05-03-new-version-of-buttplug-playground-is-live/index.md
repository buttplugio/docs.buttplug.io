[https://buttplug.world/playground](https://buttplug.world/playground)Finally finished overhauling Playground with Typescript 2.8, Vuetify, Webpack 4, etc... It's now much cleaner codewise, though also 75% larger somehow (probably due to some issues with Vuetify that I'm still waiting on resolutions for).

For new patrons out there: Playground is the our web-based minimal testing/control application. It allows you to connect to vibrating/rotating/stroking devices and set controls for them. It doesn't do much, but it's super handy if you don't need to do much. :)

One of the nice features is that the About panel on the sidebar is now actually useful. You can use it to see what version of Buttplug is running under Playground, as well as when it was built. This is autogenerated on deploy so it should stay up to date.

Next up, overhauling Syncydink. Finally.
