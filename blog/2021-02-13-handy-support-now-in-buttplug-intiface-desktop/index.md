title: "Handy Support Now In Buttplug Intiface Desktop"
date: 2021-02-13
---As of about an hour ago, support for The Handy stroker ([https://thehandy.buttplug.io)](https://thehandy.buttplug.io)) is now available in Buttplug. It basically acts similar to the Launch or Keon, allowing setting of goal position and movement time. Seems to work pretty reliably.

Gonna try to get a new version of VAMLaunch out, though I currently have no way to test that so I'm gonna have to figure that out.

Note that you'll need to be on Handy Firmware v3 Beta 2. More info on how to get that on the Handy subreddit:
