title: "New Metafetish Discord Invite Link"
date: 2018-03-09
---[https://discord.gg/t9g9RuD](https://discord.gg/t9g9RuD)Our old invite link was set to kick people who didn't say anything if they disconnected, but it kinda went way farther than that and randomly disconnected a ton of users. So we've fixed that but now require a new link to get to the discord.

Remember, if you're a Patron of any tier, you get a special role!
