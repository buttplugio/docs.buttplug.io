title: Condensed Whats Qdot Up To This Week 2020 09 07 Edition

The last 2 days have been a sprint to fix bugs introduced in Intiface Desktop v17, of which there were (and still are) many. The biggest issue was generation and usage of self signed secure certs (which many users have set up but few may actually need, something I need to figure out), which is now fixed as of about an hour ago. 

Expect a new version of Intiface Desktop out in the next couple of days, and a full update next week.
