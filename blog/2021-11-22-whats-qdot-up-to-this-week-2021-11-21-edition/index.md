More than last week! (An admittedly low bar.)

### Buttplug / Intiface Desktop
After finally wearing myself out on Forza Horizon 5, last weekend I got back to work on Buttplug and Intiface Desktop, and made quite a bit of progress!

<!--truncate-->

Enough that there should be an alpha version of the new Intiface Desktop available to patrons this week! It's pretty much ready to go, just want to poke a few more things in it first.

Right now, the system is... pretty much where the Intiface Desktop is. The only extra feature is the ability to set device allow/deny lists, meaning you'll ONLY connect to certain devices (allow) or will NEVER connect to certain devices (deny). This will be handy for the reports I'm getting of multiple people using devices in the same vicinity.

It's missing extra device configuration (for the OSR-2/Nobra/etc) but that'll be coming back in shortly, and may be back in before the alpha ships this week depending on my schedule.

These updates have required changes to both Intiface CLI (aka the "Intiface engine") and Buttplug, so there will be releases of those coming too (those can ship before the new desktop ships).

In Buttplug, the big update is that we now handle with Lovense Gush, with Lovense Hyphy support coming later this week.

### Other Stuff

 - I still have youtube videos to finish editing, we'll see if I get that done this week.
 - The [KGoal Boost](https://www.kgoal.com/?rfsn=6183821.98f400&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=6183821.98f400) ships next week. Assuming it's as shitpost-worthy as it looks, I'm expecting this'll be a lot of fun.

That's it for now. Hoping the productivity keeps up this week. Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
