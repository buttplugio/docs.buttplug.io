title: "Buttplug Playground Aka The Launch Manual Control App Everyone Wanted"
date: 2017-10-02
---[https://buttplug.world/playground](https://buttplug.world/playground)So far, all of the applications for Buttplug has been about outside media. Movies, games, etc... 

Decided to go more minimal and just make a web app for testing toys and basic "manual" control. It's called Playground.

<!--truncate-->

The Buttplug connection interface is the same one Syncydink uses. However, this time, instead of video sync, when you select devices to use a control system pops up. 

For vibration, there's a slider to set speed. 

For the Launch, there's a range slider to set the oscillation range, and a speed slider. You can then make the launch oscillate between the two chosen positions at the selected speed. You can also change positions/speed while it's oscillating. So, basically, it's what everyone has been asking for since April. :|

If there's any other features you'd like to see, like patterns, random, settings, etc, lemme know. I'd like to keep things fairly simple up front since this will most likely be our new entry point for people new to Buttplug, but I can always add "advanced controls" or something and provide UI to choose.

I'll be making a Websocket Server tutorial video using this next, so if things are confusing, let me know and I'll try to either improve the interface or talk about it in the video.
