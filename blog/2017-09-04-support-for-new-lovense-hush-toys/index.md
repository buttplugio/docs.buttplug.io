Just a heads up since Lovense Hush toys seem to be pretty popular.We had a user show up on the Discord today reporting a Hush toy that would not connect to the Windows Buttplug App Suite. They had direct ordered it and received it sometime last week (last week of August 2017). 

Turns out that Lovense is loading new firmware onto toys, and also changing their device names and service IDs. We've updated the Windows Buttplug Server for this new device, and CI Builds of 0.1.0.464 or later should work. I'm hoping to get support into buttplug-js this evening.

We're now also looking at more flexible ways to define and add hardware to Buttplug across all platforms, that will hopefully make problems like this easier to remedy. More information on that as we figure out how we're gonna do it.
