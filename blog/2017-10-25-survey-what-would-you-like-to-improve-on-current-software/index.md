While filming the Buttplug Websocket tutorial, I realized how painful it is to do the first SSL setup in the websocket server. On top of that, we're still not signaling to users what toys actually work with their setup.These are things I get lots of questions about, yet we haven't really been addressing those questions lately.

I'm trying to do some development planning right now, and I'd like some feedback on what'd you'd like to see improved if you use Buttplug/Syncydink/ScriptPlayer/etc..., or if you can't, why not.

<!--truncate-->

For  example, here's some things I'm aware of (if you're having problems  with things in this list, please still comment here and let me know,  just so I can get some basic numbers together):

- Lack of Windows 7 Support  
- Not enough feedback on which toys work, when, and why  
- Secure socket setup for websocket server doesn't give enough feedback  
- No available list of applications that can be used with Buttplug

We're looking for everything from the biggest issues to the smallest nits, so let us know what you think!
