[https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/f54kxtmhtmprm62n/artifacts/ButtplugNodeServer-1.0.10.7z](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/f54kxtmhtmprm62n/artifacts/ButtplugNodeServer-1.0.10.7z)After our major library upgrade last month, I forgot to bring the Win7 alpha server up to date with it. That's all fixed now. The above executable should work with Playground/Syncydink again.

Lemme know if you have any problems.
