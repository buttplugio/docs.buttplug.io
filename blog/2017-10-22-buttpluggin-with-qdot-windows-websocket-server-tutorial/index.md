SEE I TOLD YOU I'D GET BACK TO MAKING VIDEOS.Even if they are pretty spectacularly boring.

This is a quick (well it still took me like 6-7 hours between scripts, editing, etc :| ) video showing how to use the Websocket server. We've got a lot of UI needs to clean up, but we're having to operate on so many fronts right now that prioritization is difficult, so instead I'm just making videos to act as a patch until our UX sucks less.

I'll be working on another one of these for the Game Vibration Router next, then a quick overview of WebBluetooth usage for non-windows platforms, then a syncydink tutorial (I realize this sounds like a lot but these are all screencasts, which take WAY less time to film), then hopefully back to fun teardown and informational vids.
