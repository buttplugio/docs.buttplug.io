title: "Questions For The Teledildonticist I Need Your Help"

In order to get more videos up on the Youtube channel, I'm starting a series of shorter videos (< 10 minutes) called "Questions For The Teledildonticist" where I just answer one question per video.

I'd like to get some questions together about sex toys, the Buttplug/Intiface projects, etc that I can answer on there. These should be questions that will hold up over the long term, so more "Why did you do [x]" or "How is [x] built", less "When will [x] be released" or "What are you currently doing on [x]".

Some current questions I'm using to start:

 - Why did you call the project Buttplug?
 - How did you get started in sex tech?
 - How does the Game Haptics Router work?
 - Why have you rewritten Buttplug so many times?
 - What's your favorite piece of hardware?

So, if you've got questions you'd like to see answered that fit those, please throw them in the comments to this post or DM them to me! Also let me know if you'd like me to use your name when asking the question, or if I should make it anonymous.
