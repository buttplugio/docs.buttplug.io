We're now 8 weeks out from the first commit in the buttplug-csharp repo. Someday we'll get to a release. Someday. Since the last update:

- We now have 2 developers working on Buttplug, soon to be 3!

<!--truncate-->

- We have support for all Lovense toys minus the Ambi (I don't have one yet and need to know the bluetooth name/services on it). This includes the new Edge prostate massager, 'cause I got mine yesterday and got support in within 3 hours of receiving it. :)

- As of the end of last week, Launch control is now FAR faster and more stable. We were waiting too long for some bluetooth calls, that's now cleaned up. It should stutter less on video sync with fast moment.

- We now have Code of Conduct and Contributor documents in the repos, in the hopes of making the project a little more welcoming.

- Fixed a few crashing bugs.

I'm working now to try and figure out a path to a first release. Some of the major blockers on that are:

- Fix up crash reporting

- Create update notification system

- Run websockets over SSL (maybe)

- Start Application Design Guidelines document (doesn't need to be finished by the time we release, just needs to have a couple of chapter drafts up somewhere)

- Update website

- Maybe comment some code somewhere. Maybe.

So yeah, lots of both technical and documentation/presentation stuff, none of it all that exciting. 

The trudging continues.
