I'm on vacation all week! Which means...

I'm playing a lot of No Man's Sky, unexpectedly. I guess I find inventory shuffling fun?

But also, there's...

# Buttplug Developer Guide
Still working on the developer guide! I've gone ahead and started editing the actual published site at

[https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io](https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io)

Because the old code/guide was going to be obsolete anyways, so might as well let people follow as I build the new stuff.

The Rust and C# examples are mostly together, but there's still a lot of editing to do for the surrounding text, and I keep finding small things in the API I want to tweak.

If you use Buttplug C# with Nuget, you'll see the 1.0.0 branch in development if you turn on pre-releases. These should be mostly stable, but may be missing functionality. I'm working to fill this in, and your best bet for updates is watching the CHANGELOGs at

# Other Apps
There's some really interesting new apps that are coming out lately. They don't have anything to do with Buttplug specifically, but I like supporting other people who are building toy control apps, so:

 - Xtoys - [https://xtoys.app](https://xtoys.app) - Really neat control web/mobile interface with all sorts of add-ons for remote control (using WebRTC!), sound reaction, web integration, etc. Not open source, but free and fun to play with! Also supports estim and hismith machines!
 - OpenFunscripter - [https://github.com/gagax1234/OpenFunscripter](https://github.com/gagax1234/OpenFunscripter) - Open source video scripting utility! JoyFunscripter isn't being updated anymore but still is distributed, OFS is aimed at being an open source alternative.

Short newsletter this week because while I don't have much to say about the dev guide, it's taking up almost all of my time. Between writing the new content and iterating on the different language APIs, it's a ton of work, but I'm hoping in the end it'll make the library useful to someone other than me.

Hoping to get back to making youtube videos this week too, have a swank 4k camera on loan that should be fun to try out. Prepare to see my horrible complexion in high resolution!

Anyways, that's it for this week. Happy holiday to all of those having holidays this week, and until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
