title: End Of Syncydink Development
date: 2020-11-28

Heads up in case anyone wants to jump ship before the subscription charge date (Dec 1).

I'm dropping development of Syncydink, which is more to say I'm just going to admit defeat and not promise updates anymore. I'm going to archive the repo but leave it up just in case other people want to fork it. It might get updated in the future, but it won't be by me.

Long story short, Syncydink needs a complete rewrite. The way that web app development works, if you don't keep up with the toolchains, things rot VERY quickly and you end up having to strip them down to the core and restart. Syncydink hasn't seen a significant update in over 2 years, and was originally written as a one-off to test some initial ideas about Buttplug. There are now many other players out there.

I came to this decision after working with trying to get Playground going over the past week with the new WASM stuff. While WASM saves me a significant amount of time for my own development, I realized how much work updating old apps to use it will take. There's just no way I can say I can get Syncydink fixed anymore. It's just been too long, and I've got too much else going on with maintaining the core Buttplug library, Intiface Desktop/GHR, etc.

Also, I just do not use or like video sync. I really have no interest in it as a platform and would much rather work on games and other interactive content.

Does that make video sync bad? Not at all! Companies like SexLikeReal, Handy, and communities like Eroscripts ([https://eroscripts.com)](https://eroscripts.com)) are all doing quite well with video sync. I just personally don't care for it and don't want to spend my extremely limited time on it.

There's already one dev that's been submitting patches to Syncydink lately, and I'm going to talk to them about possibly taking over maintenance. If that happens, I'll post here as well as on eroscripts.

If you were/are supporting me in hopes of Syncydink updates, I totally understand if you unsub. Thanks for the support so far.
