### Buttpluggin' With qDot
My original plan was to hunker down and work on buttplug-rs in order to get it done enough to replace C#/JS in intiface desktop.

Then I put a search watch on "teledildonics" on twitter.

Turns out, a more people are talking about the topic than usual. I decided to jump on that interest and have been working on livestreams of how to design and build a teledildonics app. The first two episodes are up now:

And the next will be later this week (I'll announce here the day before it happens). So far, that's going pretty well.

Once I get a very basic app up and running, I'm going to livestream building little experiments on top of it, including interfacing with games, chat clients, etc. Basically just trying to lay down more video content while there are bored people out there to watch it.

If you've got any requests, lemme know!

### Buttplug
Buttplug itself is coming along well. The backward compatibility system is mostly done, which is a huge step toward getting this distributed as part of Intiface Desktop. After that, I just need to finish up v2 message implementations (battery, rssi, patterns, etc) and it'll hopefully be ready to go.

Once all that's finished, I'm going to start looking at building C# and other libraries on top of it, so all languages will use the same code underneath. Debugging that will be "fun", but it's becoming a more common pattern and there are tools out there to make it suck less.

### Game Haptics Router
Been getting some bug reports in on the GHR, so I put out v6 a week ago. Just changes load order of the XInput hijack DLLs, but seems to fix a few issues people were having.

### Coming Up
I have a 3D Printer on the way that should show up any day now, so I'll be doing some project/toy prints on that around printing face shields for donation. Other than that, who knows. Things have been wild enough over the past week that it's kinda hard to predict where things will be when I write the next update. I'm kinda addicted to NeosVR ( [https://neosvr.com/](https://neosvr.com/) ) right now too, so I suspect there will be a Buttplug implementation happening for that soon too.

Until next week, Keep Buttpluggin'!
