title: "Buttplug Development Video Update"
date: 2018-01-29
---Here's a quick update about what's going on around Buttplug HQ (aka my office in my house)We released Buttplug C# 0.2 and Buttplug-js 0.5 last week. So far, the C# version has seen over 160 downloads and zero crashes reported so far, which is pretty exciting. 

The JS library has seen... 3 point releases because it's complicated and our tests still aren't covering everything we need. :|

I've updated both Buttplug Playground and Syncydink to use the new version of our libraries, though outside of extra toy support, there's not gonna be too much noticeable there yet.

We've also had some reports that FeelTech has changed the file format for WankzVR/MilfVR haptics files again, so new files may be broken at the moment. Hopefully going to fix that in the next day or two.

In terms of projects, right now my main focus is finishing the first round of our Interactive Tutorial. So far, we've used either the forums or direct communication via twitter/discord/etc to teach people how to use the software. I'm now working on a system that uses the Twine Interaction Fiction engine to bring people up on what Buttplug is, how it works, and get them connected, without having to send them to out-of-date message board posts or talking to them myself. You can see it in development at

If you can think of any problems you had getting things set up, or ideas we should include, feel free to comment here! It's pretty bare-bones at the moment. We'll be expanding it to have images/gifs to show what to expect in installation steps, more story paths to show how you can play movies/games/etc with Buttplug, and whatever else we can come up with.

On the development side, I made some developer tools to make it easier to write web apps for buttplug without having hardware around. You can check out a demo of these at

Just tweeted about them today ([https://twitter.com/buttplugio/status/958085272289202176)](https://twitter.com/buttplugio/status/958085272289202176)) and got some good feedback!

I've got a couple of new Buttpluggin' With qDot videos ready to make, having finished editing their scripts. Making the videos and starting work on Playground/Syncydink upgrades are mostly waiting on the tutorial being finished, because I don't want to announce a new round of updates then have to tell everyone how to use those updates personally.

Thanks for your ongoing support!
