Just wanted to say, anyone that does not want to deal with the new Patreon fee model, no hard feelings if you stop support for my campaign. What I have gotten so far has been very appreciated, and I plan to continue my patreon campaign, as well as look at other options like Ko-fi. 

I know the new fee system change is pretty rough though, and I'm not gonna hold it against anyone if they don't agree with it.

Thanks for your support.
