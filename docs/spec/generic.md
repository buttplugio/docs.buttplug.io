# Generic Device Messages

Generic device messages pertain to classes of devices, versus specific devices. For instance, the
generic ValueCmd with a FeatureType of Vibrate should be supported by all vibrating devices, and
StopDeviceCmd should be supported by all devices in order to stop them from whatever their current
action may be.

## StopDeviceCmd

**Description:** Client request to have the server stop a device from whatever actions it may be

device it supports.

## StopAllDevices

**Description:** Sent by the client to tell the server to stop all devices. Can be used for
emergency situations, on client shutdown for cleanup, etcâ€¦ While this is considered a Device
Message, since it pertains to all currently connected devices, it does not specify a device index
(and does not end with 'Cmd').
