# Getting Help

If you have any questions about Buttplug that aren't answered by this guide, or if there's something you don't understand, please feel free to reach out to the community and library developers! There are multiple ways you can do this.

- [Buttplug Discord Server](https://discord.buttplug.io)
  - This is your best bet for real time help!
- [Buttplug Discourse Forums](https://discuss.buttplug.io)
  - If you prefer forums over discord, we've got those too!
- Buttplug Social Media
  - We're on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/buttplug.io) and [the Fediverse](https://buttplug.zone/@buttplugio)! DMs are open, but replies may be slow.
- [Issues and Discussion Areas on the Github Org](https://github.com/buttplugio)
  - The org is made up of many repos, so if you're asking about a specific implementation of
    Buttplug, its best to do so on that repo (but usually
    [buttplug](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug)). File an issue and we'll get things figured
    out.
