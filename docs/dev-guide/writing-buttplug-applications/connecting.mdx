# Connecting to a Buttplug Server

Once you've created a connector, it's time to connect to a server!

As all connector setup was done via the Connector setup, this is now just down to dealing with
whether the connection process actually worked or not.

Network connections for websockets can fail due to usual connection issues (wrong address, server
not up, network not on, etc...). There is also a chance that the client and server could have a
version mismatch. We'll cover this in the next section.

## Client/Server Compatibility

tl;dr As long as the server API version is equal to or greater (newer) than the client API version,
things should be fine.

To see the full explanation and rules on API versioning, see the [protocol portion of the architecture
section.](/docs/dev-guide/architecture/protocol-in-depth#spec-versions-and-message-additions)

## What to Expect on Successful Connect

In most cases, connectors are only used for the initial connection setup, then you can pretty much
forget about them after that. Everything will look the same across all connector types from here on
out.

Now that you know how to get a Buttplug session running, you're ready to enumerate and control
devices!
