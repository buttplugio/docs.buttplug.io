# Device Enumeration

Once the client and server are connected, they can start communicating about devices.

## Scanning

To find out about new devices during a session, Buttplug Client libraries will usually provide 2
functions and an event/callback:

- StartScanning (Method)
  - Tells the server to start looking for devices via the Device Manager. This will start the
    Bluetooth Manager doing a bluetooth scan, the USB manager looking for USB or HID devices,
    etc... for all loaded Device Communication Managers
  - **Note:** Scanning may still require user input on the server side! For instance, using
    WebBluetooth in browsers with buttplug-wasm will require the user to interact with browser
    dialogs, so calling StartScanning() may open that dialog.
- StopScanning (Method)
  - Tells the server to stop scanning for devices if it hasn't already.

### ScanningFinished Event (WASM only)

ScanningFinished is now only used for the Typescript WASM Server setup. For Desktop/Mobile apps
connecting to Intiface Central, you do not need to watch for the ScanningFinished event, as most
Device Scanners run until StopScanning is called.

- ScanningFinished (Event/Callback)
  - When all device communication managers have finished looking for new devices, this event will
    be fired from the client to let applications know to update their UI (for instance, to change a
    button name from "Stop Scanning" to "Start Scanning"). This event may fire without StopScanning
    ever being called, as there are cases where scanning is not indefinite (once again,
    WebBluetooth is a good example, as well as things like gamepad scanners).

## Device Connection Events and Storage

There are 2 events related to device connections that the client may fire:

- DeviceAdded (Event/Callback)
    - This event will contain a new device object. It denotes that the server is now connected to
      this device, and that the device can take commands.
- DeviceRemoved (Event/Callback)
    - This event will fire when a device disconnects from the server for some reason. It should
      contain and instance of the device that disconnected.
    
While the events are handy for updating UI, Client implementations usually also hold a list of
currently connected devices that can be used for iteration if needed.

Both events may be fired at any time during a Buttplug Client/Server session. DeviceAdded can be
called outside of StartScanning()/StopScanning(), and even right after connect in some instances.

## Already Connected Devices

Servers will normally stay up and running until users stop them, meaning they can have connections
from several different clients over the session. This means that devices may already be connected to
servers when you connect.

Most clients will query the server for already connected devices when they finish their handshake,
after which they will then present them as DeviceAdded() events.

This means you will want to have your event handlers set up **BEFORE** connecting, in order to catch
these messages. You can also check the Devices storage (usually a public collection on your Client
instance, like an array or list) after connect to see what devices are there.

## Code Example

Here's some examples of how device enumeration works in different implementations of Buttplug.
