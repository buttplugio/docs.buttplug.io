# A Cookbook for Your Butt

Now that you know the basics of Buttplug, it's time to move on to more advanced topics.

This section is not presented in any specific order, but rather presents a diverse set of subject matter having to do with how Buttplug functions as a library, some of the more esoteric features it presents, and how best to use it in your application. While nothing in this chapter is required to use the library, much of the information will prove handy as you try to create experiences for your users.
