# Embedding

The Application Guide portion of this document focuses solely on connecting to Intiface Central in
order to access a Buttplug Server. However, there are some situations in which embedding a server in
your application may be desirable, or even required.

For instance, you may want your users to be able to use your application right after install,
without having to also install Intiface Central. Less commonly, your application may be deployed on
a platform where talking to Intiface Central may not be available (like running completely in a web
browser, or standalone on mobile).

There are two methods of achieving this, each with their own drawbacks.

:::caution Before You Tackle Embedding

If you are going to embed an engine, try to make sure you also provide a way for the user to access
Intiface Central if they so choose. This will allow users to use new hardware that may not be
supported by the version of Buttplug/Intiface you embed in your application.

If you embed without giving users a way to connect outward to updated versions, you may get
complaints once new hardware is released and your program does not support it.

:::

## Embedding Intiface Engine

For desktop applications that can spawn external processes, one option is to ship with the latest
version of [Intiface Engine](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-engine). This is a command line
version of the Buttplug Server, with all configuration elements exposed via arguments.

The downsides here are mostly related to user configuration. Buttplug ships with support for a lot
of devices, and many of those devices may require special configuration by the user. This
configuration is handled by Intiface Central, so that when a users starts a server using Central,
they can only load what they need and expect. When embedding a server, you may have to use a default
setup that may not work with the user's needs.

Another downside is modern OS sandboxing. Windows and macOS do not like programs that start other
programs, and you may run into problems with a user's security system blocking process execution.

The usual strategy for embedding an engine is:

- Ship your application with a copy of Intiface Engine for the platform your application is on.
- When your application starts, try to connect to Intiface Central (or give the user the ability to
  pick a new address, as they may be using the mobile app and have to set a new address).
- If no port is found for Intiface Central, you can try starting your own Intiface Engine process
  and connecting to that.

You will need to provide the user with a way to restart the engine process in case things lock up or
crash.

## Embedded Servers and Connectors

:::warning You Probably Don't Want This

For most normal desktop and mobile applications, you do not want to use an embedded connector. While
embedded connections used to be recommended for Buttplug development, they have ended up causing
more harm than good, but are still required for certain situations, which is why they're included
here.

This section should really only be used if:

- You want a fully web based system with no outside dependencies (i.e. using WASM inside the
  browser)
- You need to compile the full server into your application for some reason. For instance, Intiface
  Central on desktop and mobile has to build with an embedded server in order to host it for other
  applications, as another process cannot be started due to sandboxing. This is a fairly rare occasion.
- Quick one-off examples in Rust since you get it for free there, and even then, you should really
  use Intiface Central

If you want to avoid your users having to download Intiface Central to use your program, see the
Embedded Engines section above.

:::

An Embedded server means both the client and server are part of the application are you building.
While doing this ends up being more convenient for the user in some ways, as they have less setup to
do and choices to make, there are a few drawbacks, including:

- If the libraries upgrade (which is how we usually deal with new hardware/protocol support), you'll
  need to upgrade your app too.
- This may tie you to a certain platform, i.e. if you're using Windows libraries, your application
  might only run on windows. This all depends on the library you're using, though.
- You may need to set up the server yourself in your application.
- The only reference server is currently written in Rust, which means using an embedded server
  requires pulling in the Rust codebase in one way or another. This is usually done with FFI of some
  sort (including compiling to WASM). Errors in this setup can be extremely difficult to debug if
  you are not familiar with your base language and FFI bindings.

There's not really much to cover about the first two problems, they're just part of the choice you
make in using this method. The example below shows how to set up a server with a bluetooth device
manager, using the configuration file built into the library.

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

Currently, this example is only available in Rust. A Javascript example will be added once the FFI
system has been rebuilt to use it.

import RustConnectorExample from '!!raw-loader!/examples/rust/src/bin/embedded_connector.rs';

<CodeBlock language="rust">{RustConnectorExample}</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
